     * Copy data from a socket to the given File location on permanent storage.  The
     * modification time and access mode of the resulting file will be set if desired,
     * although group/all rwx modes will be stripped: the restored file will not be
     * accessible from outside the target application even if the original file was.
     * If the {@code type} parameter indicates that the result should be a directory,
     * the socket parameter may be {@code null}; even if it is valid, no data will be
     * read from it in this case.
     * <p>
     * If the {@code mode} argument is negative, then the resulting output file will not
     * have its access mode or last modification time reset as part of this operation.
     *
     * @param data Socket supplying the data to be copied to the output file.  If the
     *    output is a directory, this may be {@code null}.
     * @param size Number of bytes of data to copy from the socket to the file.  At least
     *    this much data must be available through the {@code data} parameter.
     * @param type Must be either {@link BackupAgent#TYPE_FILE} for ordinary file data
     *    or {@link BackupAgent#TYPE_DIRECTORY} for a directory.
     * @param mode Unix-style file mode (as used by the chmod(2) syscall) to be set on
     *    the output file or directory.  group/all rwx modes are stripped even if set
     *    in this parameter.  If this parameter is negative then neither
     *    the mode nor the mtime values will be applied to the restored file.
     * @param mtime A timestamp in the standard Unix epoch that will be imposed as the
     *    last modification time of the output file.  if the {@code mode} parameter is
     *    negative then this parameter will be ignored.
     * @param outFile Location within the filesystem to place the data.  This must point
     *    to a location that is writeable by the caller, preferably using an absolute path.
     * @throws IOException
