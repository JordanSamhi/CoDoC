     * Sets the off-host Secure Element for the given service.
     *
     * <p>If off-host SE was initially set (either statically
     * through the manifest, or dynamically by using this API),
     * it will be replaced with this one. All AIDs registered by
     * this service will be re-routed to this Secure Element if
     * successful. AIDs that was statically assigned using manifest
     * will re-route to off-host SE that stated in manifest after NFC
     * toggle.
     *
     * <p>Note that you can only set off-host SE for a service that
     * is running under the same UID as the caller of this API. Typically
     * this means you need to call this from the same
     * package as the service itself, though UIDs can also
     * be shared between packages using shared UIDs.
     *
     * <p>Registeration will be successful only if the Secure Element
     * exists on the device.
