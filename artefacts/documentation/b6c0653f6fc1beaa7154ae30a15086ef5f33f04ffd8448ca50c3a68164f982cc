     * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has
     * begun.
     *
     * <p>Must be followed by a call to {@link #endSectionAsync} using the same
     * tag. Unlike {@link #beginSection} and {@link #endSection},
     * asynchronous events do not need to be nested. The name and cookie used to
     * begin an event must be used to end it.</p>
     *
     * @param methodName The method name to appear in the trace.
     * @param cookie Unique identifier for distinguishing simultaneous events
