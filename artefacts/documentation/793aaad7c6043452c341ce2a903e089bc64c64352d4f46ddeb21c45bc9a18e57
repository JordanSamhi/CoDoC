     * Compiles an SQL statement into a reusable pre-compiled statement object.
     * The parameters are identical to {@link #execSQL(String)}. You may put ?s in the
     * statement and fill in those values with {@link SQLiteProgram#bindString}
     * and {@link SQLiteProgram#bindLong} each time you want to run the
     * statement. Statements may not return result sets larger than 1x1.
     *<p>
     * No two threads should be using the same {@link SQLiteStatement} at the same time.
     *
     * @param sql The raw SQL statement, may contain ? for unknown values to be
     *            bound later.
     * @return A pre-compiled {@link SQLiteStatement} object. Note that
     * {@link SQLiteStatement}s are not synchronized, see the documentation for more details.
