     * Notify the scroller that we've reached a vertical boundary.
     * Normally the information to handle this will already be known
     * when the animation is started, such as in a call to one of the
     * fling functions. However there are cases where this cannot be known
     * in advance. This function will animate a parabolic motion from
     * startY to finalY.
     *
     * @param startY Starting/current Y position
     * @param finalY Desired final Y position
     * @param overY Magnitude of overscroll allowed. This should be the maximum
     *              desired distance from finalY. Absolute value - must be positive.
