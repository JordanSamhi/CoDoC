     * Create an RFCOMM {@link BluetoothSocket} socket ready to start an insecure
     * outgoing connection to this remote device using SDP lookup of uuid.
     * <p> The communication channel will not have an authenticated link key
     * i.e it will be subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. For Bluetooth 2.1
     * devices, the link key will be encrypted, as encryption is mandatory.
     * For legacy devices (pre Bluetooth 2.1 devices) the link key will
     * be not be encrypted. Use {@link #createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord} if an
     * encrypted and authenticated communication channel is desired.
     * <p>This is designed to be used with {@link
     * BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingInsecureRfcommWithServiceRecord} for peer-peer
     * Bluetooth applications.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothSocket#connect} to initiate the outgoing
     * connection. This will also perform an SDP lookup of the given uuid to
     * determine which channel to connect to.
     * <p>The remote device will be authenticated and communication on this
     * socket will be encrypted.
     * <p>Hint: If you are connecting to a Bluetooth serial board then try
     * using the well-known SPP UUID 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB.
     * However if you are connecting to an Android peer then please generate
     * your own unique UUID.
