     * Process an input buffer and place the histogram into the
     * output allocation. The output allocation may be a narrower
     * vector size than the input. In this case the vector size of
     * the output is used to determine how many of the input
     * channels are used in the computation. This is useful if you
     * have an RGBA input buffer but only want the histogram for
     * RGB.
     *
     * 1D and 2D input allocations are supported.
     *
     * @param ain The input image
     * @param opt LaunchOptions for clipping
