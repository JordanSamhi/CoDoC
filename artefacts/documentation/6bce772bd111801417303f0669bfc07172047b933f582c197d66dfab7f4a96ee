     * Call this when something has changed which has invalidated the
     * layout of this view. This will schedule a layout pass of the view
     * tree. This should not be called while the view hierarchy is currently in a layout
     * pass ({@link #isInLayout()}. If layout is happening, the request may be honored at the
     * end of the current layout pass (and then layout will run again) or after the current
     * frame is drawn and the next layout occurs.
     *
     * <p>Subclasses which override this method should call the superclass method to
     * handle possible request-during-layout errors correctly.</p>
