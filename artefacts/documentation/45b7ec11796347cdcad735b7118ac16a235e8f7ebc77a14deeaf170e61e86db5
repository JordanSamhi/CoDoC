     * Returns the transmission power level of the packet in dBm. Returns {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE}
     * if the field is not set. This value can be used to calculate the path loss of a received
     * packet using the following equation:
     * <p>
     * <code>pathloss = txPowerLevel - rssi</code>
