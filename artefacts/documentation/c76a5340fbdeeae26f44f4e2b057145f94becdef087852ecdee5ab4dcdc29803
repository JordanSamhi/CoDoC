     * Notify the scroller that we've reached a horizontal boundary.
     * Normally the information to handle this will already be known
     * when the animation is started, such as in a call to one of the
     * fling functions. However there are cases where this cannot be known
     * in advance. This function will transition the current motion and
     * animate from startX to finalX as appropriate.
     *
     * @param startX Starting/current X position
     * @param finalX Desired final X position
     * @param overX Magnitude of overscroll allowed. This should be the maximum
     *              desired distance from finalX. Absolute value - must be positive.
