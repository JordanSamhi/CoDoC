     * Apply a gravity constant to an object.
     *
     * @param gravity The desired placement of the object, as defined by the
     *                constants in this class.
     * @param w The horizontal size of the object.
     * @param h The vertical size of the object.
     * @param container The frame of the containing space, in which the object
     *                  will be placed.  Should be large enough to contain the
     *                  width and height of the object.
     * @param xAdj Offset to apply to the X axis.  If gravity is LEFT this
     *             pushes it to the right; if gravity is RIGHT it pushes it to
     *             the left; if gravity is CENTER_HORIZONTAL it pushes it to the
     *             right or left; otherwise it is ignored.
     * @param yAdj Offset to apply to the Y axis.  If gravity is TOP this pushes
     *             it down; if gravity is BOTTOM it pushes it up; if gravity is
     *             CENTER_VERTICAL it pushes it down or up; otherwise it is
     *             ignored.
     * @param outRect Receives the computed frame of the object in its
     *                container.
     * @param layoutDirection The layout direction.
