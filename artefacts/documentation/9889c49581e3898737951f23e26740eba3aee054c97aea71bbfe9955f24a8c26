     * Called when the fragment's activity has been created and this
     * fragment's view hierarchy instantiated.  It can be used to do final
     * initialization once these pieces are in place, such as retrieving
     * views or restoring state.  It is also useful for fragments that use
     * {@link #setRetainInstance(boolean)} to retain their instance,
     * as this callback tells the fragment when it is fully associated with
     * the new activity instance.  This is called after {@link #onCreateView}
     * and before {@link #onViewStateRestored(Bundle)}.
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState If the fragment is being re-created from
     * a previous saved state, this is the state.
