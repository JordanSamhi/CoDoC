     * Set the number of pages that should be retained to either side of the
     * current page in the view hierarchy in an idle state. Pages beyond this
     * limit will be recreated from the adapter when needed.
     *
     * <p>This is offered as an optimization. If you know in advance the number
     * of pages you will need to support or have lazy-loading mechanisms in place
     * on your pages, tweaking this setting can have benefits in perceived smoothness
     * of paging animations and interaction. If you have a small number of pages (3-4)
     * that you can keep active all at once, less time will be spent in layout for
     * newly created view subtrees as the user pages back and forth.</p>
     *
     * <p>You should keep this limit low, especially if your pages have complex layouts.
     * This setting defaults to 1.</p>

     * @param limit How many pages will be kept offscreen in an idle state.
