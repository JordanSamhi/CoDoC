     * Sets whether changes to parent should use an overlay or not. When the parent
     * change doesn't use an overlay, it affects the transforms of the child. The
     * default value is <code>true</code>.
     *
     * <p>Note: when Overlays are not used when a parent changes, a view can be clipped when
     * it moves outside the bounds of its parent. Setting
     * {@link android.view.ViewGroup#setClipChildren(boolean)} and
     * {@link android.view.ViewGroup#setClipToPadding(boolean)} can help. Also, when
     * Overlays are not used and the parent is animating its location, the position of the
     * child view will be relative to its parent's final position, so it may appear to "jump"
     * at the beginning.</p>
     *
     * @param reparentWithOverlay <code>true</code> when a changed parent should execute the
     *                            transition inside the scene root's overlay or <code>false</code>
     *                            if a parent change only affects the transform of the transitioning
     *                            view.
