     * Initialize the contents of the Activity's standard options menu.  You
     * should place your menu items in to <var>menu</var>.
     *
     * <p>This is only called once, the first time the options menu is
     * displayed.  To update the menu every time it is displayed, see
     * {@link #onPrepareOptionsMenu}.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation populates the menu with standard system
     * menu items.  These are placed in the {@link Menu#CATEGORY_SYSTEM} group so that
     * they will be correctly ordered with application-defined menu items.
     * Deriving classes should always call through to the base implementation.
     *
     * <p>You can safely hold on to <var>menu</var> (and any items created
     * from it), making modifications to it as desired, until the next
     * time onCreateOptionsMenu() is called.
     *
     * <p>When you add items to the menu, you can implement the Activity's
     * {@link #onOptionsItemSelected} method to handle them there.
     *
     * @param menu The options menu in which you place your items.
     *
     * @return You must return true for the menu to be displayed;
     *         if you return false it will not be shown.
