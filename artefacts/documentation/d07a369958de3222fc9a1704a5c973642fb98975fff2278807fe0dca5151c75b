     * As of ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH we are automatically adding padding to widgets targeting
     * ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH and higher. The new widget design guidelines strongly recommend
     * that widget developers do not add extra padding to their widgets. This will help
     * achieve consistency among widgets.
     *
     * Note: this method is only needed by developers of AppWidgetHosts. The method is provided in
     * order for the AppWidgetHost to account for the automatic padding when computing the number
     * of cells to allocate to a particular widget.
     *
     * @param context the current context
     * @param component the component name of the widget
     * @param padding Rect in which to place the output, if null, a new Rect will be allocated and
     *                returned
     * @return default padding for this widget, in pixels
