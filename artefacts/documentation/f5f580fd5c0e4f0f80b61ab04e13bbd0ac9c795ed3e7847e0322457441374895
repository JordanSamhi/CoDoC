     * Returns whether the current Scroller is currently returning to a valid position.
     * Valid bounds were provided by the
     * {@link #fling(int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int)} method.
     *
     * One should check this value before calling
     * {@link #startScroll(int, int, int, int)} as the interpolation currently in progress
     * to restore a valid position will then be stopped. The caller has to take into account
     * the fact that the started scroll will start from an overscrolled position.
     *
     * @return true when the current position is overscrolled and in the process of
     *         interpolating back to a valid value.
