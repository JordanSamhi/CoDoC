     * Convenience function for retrieving a value from the secure settings
     * value list as an integer.  Note that internally setting values are
     * always stored as strings; this function converts the string to an
     * integer for you.
     * <p>
     * This version does not take a default value.  If the setting has not
     * been set, or the string value is not a number,
     * it throws {@link SettingNotFoundException}.
     *
     * @param cr The ContentResolver to access.
     * @param name The name of the setting to retrieve.
     * @param index The index of the list
     *
     * @throws SettingNotFoundException Thrown if a setting by the given
     * name can't be found or the setting value is not an integer.
     *
     * @return The value at the given index of settings.
     * @hide
