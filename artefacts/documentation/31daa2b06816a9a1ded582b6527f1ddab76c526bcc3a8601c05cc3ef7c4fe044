     * Returns whether RecyclerView is currently computing a layout.
     * <p>
     * If this method returns true, it means that RecyclerView is in a lockdown state and any
     * attempt to update adapter contents will result in an exception because adapter contents
     * cannot be changed while RecyclerView is trying to compute the layout.
     * <p>
     * It is very unlikely that your code will be running during this state as it is
     * called by the framework when a layout traversal happens or RecyclerView starts to scroll
     * in response to system events (touch, accessibility etc).
     * <p>
     * This case may happen if you have some custom logic to change adapter contents in
     * response to a View callback (e.g. focus change callback) which might be triggered during a
     * layout calculation. In these cases, you should just postpone the change using a Handler or a
     * similar mechanism.
     *
     * @return <code>true</code> if RecyclerView is currently computing a layout, <code>false</code>
     *         otherwise
