         * the number of pixels that the item view should be inset by, similar to padding or margin.
         * The default implementation sets the bounds of outRect to 0 and returns.
         *
         * <p>
         * If this ItemDecoration does not affect the positioning of item views, it should set
         * all four fields of <code>outRect</code> (left, top, right, bottom) to zero
         * before returning.
         *

         * If you need to access Adapter for additional data, you can call
         * {@link RecyclerView#getChildAdapterPosition(View)} to get the adapter position of the
         * View.
         *
