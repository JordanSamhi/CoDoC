     * The TypeEvaluator will be automatically determined based on the type of values
     * supplied to PropertyValuesHolder. The evaluator can be manually set, however, if so
     * desired. This may be important in cases where either the type of the values supplied
     * do not match the way that they should be interpolated between, or if the values
     * are of a custom type or one not currently understood by the animation system. Currently,
     * only values of type float and int (and their Object equivalents: Float
     * and Integer) are  correctly interpolated; all other types require setting a TypeEvaluator.
