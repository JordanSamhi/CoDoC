     * Create an RFCOMM {@link BluetoothSocket} ready to start a secure
     * outgoing connection to this remote device using SDP lookup of uuid.
     * <p>This is designed to be used with {@link
     * BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord} for peer-peer
     * Bluetooth applications.
     * <p>Use {@link BluetoothSocket#connect} to initiate the outgoing
     * connection. This will also perform an SDP lookup of the given uuid to
     * determine which channel to connect to.
     * <p>The remote device will be authenticated and communication on this
     * socket will be encrypted.
     * <p> Use this socket only if an authenticated socket link is possible.
     * Authentication refers to the authentication of the link key to
     * prevent man-in-the-middle type of attacks.
     * For example, for Bluetooth 2.1 devices, if any of the devices does not
     * have an input and output capability or just has the ability to
     * display a numeric key, a secure socket connection is not possible.
     * In such a case, use {@link #createInsecureRfcommSocketToServiceRecord}.
     * For more details, refer to the Security Model section 5.2 (vol 3) of
     * Bluetooth Core Specification version 2.1 + EDR.
     * <p>Hint: If you are connecting to a Bluetooth serial board then try
     * using the well-known SPP UUID 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB.
     * However if you are connecting to an Android peer then please generate
     * your own unique UUID.

     * @param uuid service record uuid to lookup RFCOMM channel

     * @throws IOException on error, for example Bluetooth not available, or insufficient
