     * Constructs a Keyframe object with the given time. The value at this time will be derived
     * from the target object when the animation first starts (note that this implies that keyframes
     * with no initial value must be used as part of an {@link ObjectAnimator}).
     * The time defines the
     * time, as a proportion of an overall animation's duration, at which the value will hold true
     * for the animation. The value for the animation between keyframes will be calculated as
     * an interpolation between the values at those keyframes.
     *
     * @param fraction The time, expressed as a value between 0 and 1, representing the fraction
     * of time elapsed of the overall animation duration.
