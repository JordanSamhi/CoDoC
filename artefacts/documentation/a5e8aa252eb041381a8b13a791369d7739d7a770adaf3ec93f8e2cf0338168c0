     * Start scrolling based on a fling gesture. The distance traveled will
     * depend on the initial velocity of the fling.
     *
     * @param startX Starting point of the scroll (X)
     * @param startY Starting point of the scroll (Y)
     * @param velocityX Initial velocity of the fling (X) measured in pixels per
     *            second.
     * @param velocityY Initial velocity of the fling (Y) measured in pixels per
     *            second
     * @param minX Minimum X value. The scroller will not scroll past this point
     *            unless overX > 0. If overfling is allowed, it will use minX as
     *            a springback boundary.
     * @param maxX Maximum X value. The scroller will not scroll past this point
     *            unless overX > 0. If overfling is allowed, it will use maxX as
     *            a springback boundary.
     * @param minY Minimum Y value. The scroller will not scroll past this point
     *            unless overY > 0. If overfling is allowed, it will use minY as
     *            a springback boundary.
     * @param maxY Maximum Y value. The scroller will not scroll past this point
     *            unless overY > 0. If overfling is allowed, it will use maxY as
     *            a springback boundary.
     * @param overX Overfling range. If > 0, horizontal overfling in either
     *            direction will be possible.
     * @param overY Overfling range. If > 0, vertical overfling in either
     *            direction will be possible.
