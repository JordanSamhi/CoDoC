     * Enable control of the Bluetooth Adapter for a single application.
     *
     * <p>Some applications need to use Bluetooth for short periods of time to
     * transfer data but don't want all the associated implications like
     * automatic connection to headsets etc.
     *
     * <p> Multiple applications can call this. This is reference counted and
     * Bluetooth disabled only when no one else is using it. There will be no UI
     * shown to the user while bluetooth is being enabled. Any user action will
     * override this call. For example, if user wants Bluetooth on and the last
     * user of this API wanted to disable Bluetooth, Bluetooth will not be
     * turned off.
     *
     * <p> This API is only meant to be used by internal applications. Third
     * party applications but use {@link #enable} and {@link #disable} APIs.
     *
     * <p> If this API returns true, it means the callback will be called.
     * The callback will be called with the current state of Bluetooth.
     * If the state is not what was requested, an internal error would be the
     * reason. If Bluetooth is already on and if this function is called to turn
     * it on, the api will return true and a callback will be called.
     *
     * <p>Requires {@link android.Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH}
     *
     * @param on True for on, false for off.
     * @param callback The callback to notify changes to the state.
