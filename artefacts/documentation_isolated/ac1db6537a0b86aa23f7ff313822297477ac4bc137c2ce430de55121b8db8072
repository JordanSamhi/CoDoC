     * Returns a {@link Lookup lookup object} which is trusted minimally.
     * It can only be used to create method handles to
     * publicly accessible fields and methods.
     * <p>
     * As a matter of pure convention, the {@linkplain Lookup#lookupClass lookup class}
     * of this lookup object will be {@link java.lang.Object}.
     *
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <em>Discussion:</em>
     * The lookup class can be changed to any other class {@code C} using an expression of the form
     * {@link Lookup#in publicLookup().in(C.class)}.
     * Since all classes have equal access to public names,
     * such a change would confer no new access rights.
     * A public lookup object is always subject to
     * <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">security manager checks</a>.
     * Also, it cannot access
     * <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#callsens">caller sensitive methods</a>.
