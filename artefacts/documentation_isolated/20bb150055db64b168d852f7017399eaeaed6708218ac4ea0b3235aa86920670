     * Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input
     * byte stream. The input stream is in a simple line-oriented
     * format as specified in
     * {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)} and is assumed to use
     * the ISO 8859-1 character encoding; that is each byte is one Latin1
     * character. Characters not in Latin1, and certain special characters,
     * are represented in keys and elements using Unicode escapes as defined in
     * section 3.3 of
     * <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>.
     * <p>
     * The specified stream remains open after this method returns.
     *
     * @param      inStream   the input stream.
     * @exception  IOException  if an error occurred when reading from the
     *             input stream.
     * @throws     IllegalArgumentException if the input stream contains a
     *             malformed Unicode escape sequence.
