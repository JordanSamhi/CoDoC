     * Sets the subjectPublicKeyAlgID criterion. The
     * {@code X509Certificate} must contain a subject public key
     * with the specified algorithm. If {@code null}, no
     * subjectPublicKeyAlgID check will be done.
     *
     * @param oid The object identifier (OID) of the algorithm to check
     *            for (or {@code null}). An OID is represented by a
     *            set of nonnegative integers separated by periods.
     * @throws IOException if the OID is invalid, such as
     * the first component being not 0, 1 or 2 or the second component
     * being greater than 39.
