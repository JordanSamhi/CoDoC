     * <p> If there is a security manager, this method first calls
     * the security manager's {@code checkSetFactory} method
     * to ensure the operation is allowed.
     * This could result in a SecurityException.
     *
     * @param      fac   the desired factory.
     * @exception  Error  if the application has already set a factory.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             {@code checkSetFactory} method doesn't allow
     *             the operation.
