     * Returns an estimate of the number of active threads in the current
     * thread's {@linkplain java.lang.ThreadGroup thread group} and its
     * subgroups. Recursively iterates over all subgroups in the current
     * thread's thread group.
     *
     * <p> The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
     * threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal
     * data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain
     * system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging
     * and monitoring purposes.
     *
     * @return  an estimate of the number of active threads in the current
     *          thread's thread group and in any other thread group that
     *          has the current thread's thread group as an ancestor
