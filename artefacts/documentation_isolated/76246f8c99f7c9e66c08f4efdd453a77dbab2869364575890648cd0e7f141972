     * Cumulates, in parallel, each element of the given array in place,
     * using the supplied function. For example if the array initially
     * holds {@code [2, 1, 0, 3]} and the operation performs addition,
     * then upon return the array holds {@code [2, 3, 3, 6]}.
     * Parallel prefix computation is usually more efficient than
     * sequential loops for large arrays.
     *
     * @param array the array, which is modified in-place by this method
     * @param op a side-effect-free, associative function to perform the
     * cumulation
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified array or function is null
