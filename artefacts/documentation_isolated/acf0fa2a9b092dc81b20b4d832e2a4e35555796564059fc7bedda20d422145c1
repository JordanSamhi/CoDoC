     * file.  The exact definition of <em>hidden</em> is system-dependent.  On
     * UNIX systems, a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with
     * a period character (<code>'.'</code>).  On Microsoft Windows systems, a file is
     * considered to be hidden if it has been marked as such in the filesystem.

     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the file denoted by this

     *          underlying platform
