     * Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file. On return, the input
     * stream will be at end of stream.
     *
     * <p> By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
     * symbolic link. If the {@link StandardCopyOption#REPLACE_EXISTING
     * REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified, and the target file already exists,
     * then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
     * file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
     * In this release, the {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is the only option
     * required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
     * supported in future releases.
     *
     * <p>  If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
     * the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
     * after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
     * stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
     * It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
     * I/O error occurs.
     *
     * <p> This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
     * writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is
     * <i>asynchronously closed</i> or the thread interrupted during the copy is
     * highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
     * specified.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage example</b>: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
     * it to a file:
     * <pre>
     *     Path path = ...
     *     URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
     *     try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
     *         Files.copy(in, path);
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   in
     *          the input stream to read from
     * @param   target
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the copy should be done
     *
     * @return  the number of bytes read or written
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the
     *          {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is not specified <i>(optional
     *          specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  DirectoryNotEmptyException
     *          the {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified but the file
     *          cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory
     *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if {@code options} contains a copy option that is not supported
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file. Where the
     *          {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified, the security
     *          manager's {@link SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete}
     *          method is invoked to check that an existing file can be deleted.
