     * Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name, locale, and class
     * loader.
     *
     * <p>This method behaves the same as calling
     * {@link #getBundle(String, Locale, ClassLoader, Control)} passing a
     * default instance of {@link Control}.
     *
     * <p><code>getBundle</code> uses the base name, the specified locale, and
     * the default locale (obtained from {@link java.util.Locale#getDefault()
     * Locale.getDefault}) to generate a sequence of <a
     * name="candidates"><em>candidate bundle names</em></a>.  If the specified
     * locale's language, script, country, and variant are all empty strings,
     * then the base name is the only candidate bundle name.  Otherwise, a list
     * of candidate locales is generated from the attribute values of the
     * specified locale (language, script, country and variant) and appended to
     * the base name.  Typically, this will look like the following:
     *
     * <pre>
     *     baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country + "_" + variant
     *     baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script + "_" + country
     *     baseName + "_" + language + "_" + script
     *     baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country + "_" + variant
     *     baseName + "_" + language + "_" + country
     *     baseName + "_" + language
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string
     * are omitted, along with the underscore.  For example, if country is an
     * empty string, the second and the fifth candidate bundle names above
     * would be omitted.  Also, if script is an empty string, the candidate names
     * including script are omitted.  For example, a locale with language "de"
     * and variant "JAVA" will produce candidate names with base name
     * "MyResource" below.
     *
     * <pre>
     *     MyResource_de__JAVA
     *     MyResource_de
     * </pre>
     *
     * In the case that the variant contains one or more underscores ('_'), a
     * sequence of bundle names generated by truncating the last underscore and
     * the part following it is inserted after a candidate bundle name with the
     * original variant.  For example, for a locale with language "en", script
     * "Latn, country "US" and variant "WINDOWS_VISTA", and bundle base name
     * "MyResource", the list of candidate bundle names below is generated:
     *
     * <pre>
     * MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
     * MyResource_en_Latn_US_WINDOWS
     * MyResource_en_Latn_US
     * MyResource_en_Latn
     * MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS_VISTA
     * MyResource_en_US_WINDOWS
     * MyResource_en_US
     * MyResource_en
     * </pre>
     *
     * <blockquote><b>Note:</b> For some <code>Locale</code>s, the list of
     * candidate bundle names contains extra names, or the order of bundle names
     * is slightly modified.  See the description of the default implementation
     * of {@link Control#getCandidateLocales(String, Locale)
     * getCandidateLocales} for details.</blockquote>
     *
     * <p><code>getBundle</code> then iterates over the candidate bundle names
     * to find the first one for which it can <em>instantiate</em> an actual
     * resource bundle. It uses the default controls' {@link Control#getFormats
     * getFormats} method, which generates two bundle names for each generated
     * name, the first a class name and the second a properties file name. For
     * each candidate bundle name, it attempts to create a resource bundle:
     *
     * <ul><li>First, it attempts to load a class using the generated class name.
     * If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class
     * loader, is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle, is accessible from
     * ResourceBundle, and can be instantiated, <code>getBundle</code> creates a
     * new instance of this class and uses it as the <em>result resource
     * bundle</em>.
     *
     * <li>Otherwise, <code>getBundle</code> attempts to locate a property
     * resource file using the generated properties file name.  It generates a
     * path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all "." characters
     * with "/" and appending the string ".properties".  It attempts to find a
     * "resource" with this name using {@link
     * java.lang.ClassLoader#getResource(java.lang.String)
     * ClassLoader.getResource}.  (Note that a "resource" in the sense of
     * <code>getResource</code> has nothing to do with the contents of a
     * resource bundle, it is just a container of data, such as a file.)  If it
     * finds a "resource", it attempts to create a new {@link
     * PropertyResourceBundle} instance from its contents.  If successful, this
     * instance becomes the <em>result resource bundle</em>.  </ul>
     *
     * <p>This continues until a result resource bundle is instantiated or the
     * list of candidate bundle names is exhausted.  If no matching resource
     * bundle is found, the default control's {@link Control#getFallbackLocale
     * getFallbackLocale} method is called, which returns the current default
     * locale.  A new sequence of candidate locale names is generated using this
     * locale and and searched again, as above.
     *
     * <p>If still no result bundle is found, the base name alone is looked up. If
     * this still fails, a <code>MissingResourceException</code> is thrown.
     *
     * <p><a name="parent_chain"> Once a result resource bundle has been found,
     * its <em>parent chain</em> is instantiated</a>.  If the result bundle already
     * has a parent (perhaps because it was returned from a cache) the chain is
     * complete.
     *
     * <p>Otherwise, <code>getBundle</code> examines the remainder of the
     * candidate locale list that was used during the pass that generated the
     * result resource bundle.  (As before, candidate bundle names where the
     * final component is an empty string are omitted.)  When it comes to the
     * end of the candidate list, it tries the plain bundle name.  With each of the
     * candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle (first
     * looking for a class and then a properties file, as described above).
     *
     * <p>Whenever it succeeds, it calls the previously instantiated resource
     * bundle's {@link #setParent(java.util.ResourceBundle) setParent} method
     * with the new resource bundle.  This continues until the list of names
     * is exhausted or the current bundle already has a non-null parent.
     *
     * <p>Once the parent chain is complete, the bundle is returned.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> <code>getBundle</code> caches instantiated resource
     * bundles and might return the same resource bundle instance multiple times.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b>The <code>baseName</code> argument should be a fully
     * qualified class name. However, for compatibility with earlier versions,
     * Sun's Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this, and so it is
     * possible to access <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>s by specifying a
     * path name (using "/") instead of a fully qualified class name (using
     * ".").
