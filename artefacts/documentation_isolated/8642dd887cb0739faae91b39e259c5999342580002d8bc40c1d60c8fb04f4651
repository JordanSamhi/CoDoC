     * Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalTime}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
     * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented here.
     * The supported fields behave as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code NANOS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of nanoseconds added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)}.
     * <li>{@code MICROS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of microseconds added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 1,000.
     * <li>{@code MILLIS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of milliseconds added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 1,000,000.
     * <li>{@code SECONDS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of seconds added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusSeconds(long)}.
     * <li>{@code MINUTES} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of minutes added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusMinutes(long)}.
     * <li>{@code HOURS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of hours added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusHours(long)}.
     * <li>{@code HALF_DAYS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of half-days added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusHours(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 12.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * All other {@code ChronoUnit} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
     * whether and how to perform the addition.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param amountToAdd  the amount of the unit to add to the result, may be negative
     * @param unit  the unit of the amount to add, not null
     * @return a {@code LocalTime} based on this time with the specified amount added, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
