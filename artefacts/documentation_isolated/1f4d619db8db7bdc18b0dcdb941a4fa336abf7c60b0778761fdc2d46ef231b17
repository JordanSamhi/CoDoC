     * <p>
     * This will query the {@link Clock#systemDefaultZone() system clock} in the default
     * time-zone to obtain the current time.
     * The offset will be calculated from the time-zone in the clock.
     * <p>
     * Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
     * because the clock is hard-coded.

     * @return the current time using the system clock and default time-zone, not null
