     * Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the
     * directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
     *
     * <p> If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
     * method returns {@code null}.  Otherwise an array of {@code File} objects
     * is returned, one for each file or directory in the directory.  Pathnames
     * denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
     * not included in the result.  Each resulting abstract pathname is
     * constructed from this abstract pathname using the {@link #File(File,
     * String) File(File,&nbsp;String)} constructor.  Therefore if this
     * pathname is absolute then each resulting pathname is absolute; if this
     * pathname is relative then each resulting pathname will be relative to
     * the same directory.
     *
     * <p> There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
     * will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
     * guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.
     *
     * <p> Note that the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines the {@link
     * java.nio.file.Files#newDirectoryStream(Path) newDirectoryStream} method
     * to open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the
     * directory. This may use less resources when working with very large
     * directories.
     *
     * @return  An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
     *          directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
     *          The array will be empty if the directory is empty.  Returns
     *          {@code null} if this abstract pathname does not denote a
     *          directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method denies read access to
     *          the directory
