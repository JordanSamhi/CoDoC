     * Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
     * <p>
     * The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
     * This day-of-week is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
     * If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
     * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} then the
     * range of the day-of-week, from 1 to 7, will be returned.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.
     *
     * @param field  the field to query the range for, not null
     * @return the range of valid values for the field, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the range for the field cannot be obtained
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported
