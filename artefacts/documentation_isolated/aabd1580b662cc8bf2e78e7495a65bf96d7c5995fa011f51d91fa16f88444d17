     * <p>A call to this method resets this signature object to the state
     * it was in when previously initialized for signing via a
     * call to {@code initSign(PrivateKey)}. That is, the object is
     * reset and available to generate another signature from the same
     * signer, if desired, via new calls to {@code update} and
     * {@code sign}.
     *
     * @return the signature bytes of the signing operation's result.
     *
     * @exception SignatureException if this signature object is not
     * initialized properly or if this signature algorithm is unable to
     * process the input data provided.
