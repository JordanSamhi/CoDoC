     * Reads into a byte array, and updates the message digest (if the
     * digest function is on).  That is, this method reads up to
     * {@code len} bytes from the input stream into the array
     * {@code b}, starting at offset {@code off}. This method
     * blocks until the data is actually
     * read. If the digest function is on (see
     * {@link #on(boolean) on}), this method will then call {@code update}
     * on the message digest associated with this stream, passing it
     * the data.
     *
     * @param b the array into which the data is read.
     *
     * @param off the starting offset into {@code b} of where the
     * data should be placed.
     *
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes to be read from the input
     * stream into b, starting at offset {@code off}.
     *
     * @return  the actual number of bytes read. This is less than
     * {@code len} if the end of the stream is reached prior to
     * reading {@code len} bytes. -1 is returned if no bytes were
     * read because the end of the stream had already been reached when
     * the call was made.
     *
     * @exception IOException if an I/O error occurs.
