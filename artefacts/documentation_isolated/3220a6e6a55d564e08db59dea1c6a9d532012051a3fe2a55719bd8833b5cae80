     * Sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the
     * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} of its elements.
     * All elements in the list must implement the {@link Comparable}
     * interface.  Furthermore, all elements in the list must be
     * <i>mutually comparable</i> (that is, {@code e1.compareTo(e2)}
     * must not throw a {@code ClassCastException} for any elements
     * {@code e1} and {@code e2} in the list).
     *
     * <p>This sort is guaranteed to be <i>stable</i>:  equal elements will
     * not be reordered as a result of the sort.
     *
     * <p>The specified list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable.
     *
     * @implNote
     * This implementation defers to the {@link List#sort(Comparator)}
     * method using the specified list and a {@code null} comparator.
     * Do not call this method from {@code List.sort()} since that can lead
     * to infinite recursion. Apps targeting APIs {@code <= 25} observe
     * backwards compatibility behavior where this method was implemented
     * on top of {@link List#toArray()}, {@link ListIterator#next()} and
     * {@link ListIterator#set(Object)}.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the list
     * @param  list the list to be sorted.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the list contains elements that are not
     *         <i>mutually comparable</i> (for example, strings and integers).
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the specified list's
     *         list-iterator does not support the {@code set} operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException (optional) if the implementation
     *         detects that the natural ordering of the list elements is
     *         found to violate the {@link Comparable} contract
