     * Sends a datagram packet to the destination, with a TTL (time-
     * to-live) other than the default for the socket.  This method
     * need only be used in instances where a particular TTL is desired;
     * otherwise it is preferable to set a TTL once on the socket, and
     * use that default TTL for all packets.  This method does <B>not
     * </B> alter the default TTL for the socket. Its behavior may be
     * affected by {@code setInterface}.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, this method first performs some
     * security checks. First, if {@code p.getAddress().isMulticastAddress()}
     * is true, this method calls the
     * security manager's {@code checkMulticast} method
     * with {@code p.getAddress()} and {@code ttl} as its arguments.
     * If the evaluation of that expression is false,
     * this method instead calls the security manager's
     * {@code checkConnect} method with arguments
     * {@code p.getAddress().getHostAddress()} and
     * {@code p.getPort()}. Each call to a security manager method
     * could result in a SecurityException if the operation is not allowed.
     *
     * @param p is the packet to be sent. The packet should contain
     * the destination multicast ip address and the data to be sent.
     * One does not need to be the member of the group to send
     * packets to a destination multicast address.
     * @param ttl optional time to live for multicast packet.
     * default ttl is 1.
     *
     * @exception IOException is raised if an error occurs i.e
     * error while setting ttl.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             {@code checkMulticast} or {@code checkConnect}
     *             method doesn't allow the send.
     *
     * @deprecated Use the following code or its equivalent instead:
     *  ......
     *  int ttl = mcastSocket.getTimeToLive();
     *  mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(newttl);
     *  mcastSocket.send(p);
     *  mcastSocket.setTimeToLive(ttl);
     *  ......
