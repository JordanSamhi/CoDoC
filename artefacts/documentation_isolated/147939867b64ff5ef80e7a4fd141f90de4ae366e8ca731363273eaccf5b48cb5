         * Convenience function for retrieving a single system settings value
         * as a {@code long}.  Note that internally setting values are always
         * stored as strings; this function converts the string to a {@code long}
         * for you.  The default value will be returned if the setting is
         * not defined or not a {@code long}.
         *
         * @param cr The ContentResolver to access.
         * @param name The name of the setting to retrieve.
         * @param def Value to return if the setting is not defined.
         *
         * @return The setting's current value, or 'def' if it is not defined
         * or not a valid {@code long}.
