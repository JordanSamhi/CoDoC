     * Returns the number of additional elements that this deque can ideally
     * (in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without
     * blocking. This is always equal to the initial capacity of this deque
     * less the current {@code size} of this deque.
     *
     * <p>Note that you <em>cannot</em> always tell if an attempt to insert
     * an element will succeed by inspecting {@code remainingCapacity}
     * because it may be the case that another thread is about to
     * insert or remove an element.
