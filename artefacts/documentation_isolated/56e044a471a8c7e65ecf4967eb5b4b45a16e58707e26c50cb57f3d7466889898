     * Executes the specified command and arguments in a separate process with
     * the specified environment and working directory.
     *
     * <p>Given an array of strings <code>cmdarray</code>, representing the
     * tokens of a command line, and an array of strings <code>envp</code>,
     * representing "environment" variable settings, this method creates
     * a new process in which to execute the specified command.
     *
     * <p>This method checks that <code>cmdarray</code> is a valid operating
     * system command.  Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
     * but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
     * non-null strings.
     *
     * <p>If <tt>envp</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, the subprocess inherits the
     * environment settings of the current process.
     *
     * <p>A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
     * be required to start a process on some operating systems.
     * As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
     * settings beyond those in the specified environment.
     *
     * <p>{@link ProcessBuilder#start()} is now the preferred way to
     * start a process with a modified environment.
     *
     * <p>The working directory of the new subprocess is specified by <tt>dir</tt>.
     * If <tt>dir</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, the subprocess inherits the
     * current working directory of the current process.
     *
     * <p>If a security manager exists, its
     * {@link SecurityManager#checkExec checkExec}
     * method is invoked with the first component of the array
     * <code>cmdarray</code> as its argument. This may result in a
     * {@link SecurityException} being thrown.
     *
     * <p>Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
     * Among the many things that can go wrong are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The operating system program file was not found.
     * <li>Access to the program file was denied.
     * <li>The working directory does not exist.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>In such cases an exception will be thrown.  The exact nature
     * of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
     * subclass of {@link IOException}.
