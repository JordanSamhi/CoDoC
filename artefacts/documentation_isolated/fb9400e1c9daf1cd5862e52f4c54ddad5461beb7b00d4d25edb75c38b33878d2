     * Completes this builder by creating the {@code DateTimeFormatter}
     * using the default locale.
     * <p>
     * This will create a formatter with the {@linkplain Locale#getDefault(Locale.Category) default FORMAT locale}.
     * Numbers will be printed and parsed using the standard DecimalStyle.
     * The resolver style will be {@link ResolverStyle#SMART SMART}.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method will end any open optional sections by repeatedly
     * calling {@link #optionalEnd()} before creating the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This builder can still be used after creating the formatter if desired,
     * although the state may have been changed by calls to {@code optionalEnd}.
     *
     * @return the created formatter, not null
