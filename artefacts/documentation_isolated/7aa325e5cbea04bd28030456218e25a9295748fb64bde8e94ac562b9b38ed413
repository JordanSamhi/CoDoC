     * Appends the specified {@code CharSequence} to this
     * sequence.
     * <p>
     * The characters of the {@code CharSequence} argument are appended,
     * in order, increasing the length of this sequence by the length of the
     * argument.
     *
     * <p>The result of this method is exactly the same as if it were an
     * invocation of this.append(s, 0, s.length());
     *
     * <p>This method synchronizes on {@code this}, the destination
     * object, but does not synchronize on the source ({@code s}).
     *
     * <p>If {@code s} is {@code null}, then the four characters
     * {@code "null"} are appended.
     *
     * @param   s the {@code CharSequence} to append.
     * @return  a reference to this object.
