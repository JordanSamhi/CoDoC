     * Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given group
     * during the previous match operation.
     *
     * <p> <a href="Pattern.html#cg">Capturing groups</a> are indexed from left
     * to right, starting at one.  Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
     * the expression <i>m.</i><tt>start(0)</tt> is equivalent to
     * <i>m.</i><tt>start()</tt>.  </p>
     *
     * @param  group
     *         The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern
     *
     * @return  The index of the first character captured by the group,
     *          or <tt>-1</tt> if the match was successful but the group
     *          itself did not match anything
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          If no match has yet been attempted,
     *          or if the previous match operation failed
     *
     * @throws  IndexOutOfBoundsException
     *          If there is no capturing group in the pattern
     *          with the given index
