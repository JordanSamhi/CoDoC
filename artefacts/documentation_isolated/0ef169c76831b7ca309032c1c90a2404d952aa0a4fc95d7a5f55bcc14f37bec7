     * <p>If this InetAddress was created with a host name,
     * this host name will be remembered and returned;
     * otherwise, a reverse name lookup will be performed
     * and the result will be returned based on the system
     * configured name lookup service. If a lookup of the name service
     * is required, call
     * {@link #getCanonicalHostName() getCanonicalHostName}.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, its
     * {@code checkConnect} method is first called
     * with the hostname and {@code -1}
     * as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed.
     * If the operation is not allowed, it will return
     * the textual representation of the IP address.
     *
     * @return  the host name for this IP address, or if the operation
     *    is not allowed by the security check, the textual
     *    representation of the IP address.
