     * Convenience method that decodes bytes in this charset into Unicode
     * characters.
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method upon a charset <tt>cs</tt> returns the
     * same result as the expression
     *
     * <pre>
     *     cs.newDecoder()
     *       .onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
     *       .onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
     *       .decode(bb); </pre>
     *
     * except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
     * decoders between successive invocations.
     *
     * <p> This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
     * sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array.  In order
     * to detect such sequences, use the {@link
     * CharsetDecoder#decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)} method directly.  </p>
     *
     * @param  bb  The byte buffer to be decoded
     *
     * @return  A char buffer containing the decoded characters
