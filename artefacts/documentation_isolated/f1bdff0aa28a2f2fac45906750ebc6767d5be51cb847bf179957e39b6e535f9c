     * Tests whether a file is writable. This method checks that a file exists
     * and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
     * allow it open the file for writing. Depending on the implementation, this
     * method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
     * other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
     * Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
     * system operations.
     *
     * <p> Note that result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no
     * guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will
     * succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
     * when using this method in security sensitive applications.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to check
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file exists and is writable; {@code false}
     *          if the file does not exist, write access would be denied because
     *          the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
     *          cannot be determined
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          is invoked to check write access to the file.
