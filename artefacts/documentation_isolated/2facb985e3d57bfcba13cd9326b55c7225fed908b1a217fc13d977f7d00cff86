     * Returns the issuer criterion as a byte array. This distinguished name
     * must match the issuer distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509Certificate}. If {@code null}, the issuer criterion
     * is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a byte
     * array containing a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in
     * X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
     * documentation for
     * {@link #setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN) setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
     *
     * @return a byte array containing the required issuer distinguished name
     *         in ASN.1 DER format (or {@code null})
     * @throws IOException if an encoding error occurs
