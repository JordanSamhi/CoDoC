     * Tests whether a file is a symbolic link.
     *
     * <p> Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
     * that the file is not a symbolic link then the file attributes can be
     * read with the {@link #readAttributes(Path,Class,LinkOption[])
     * readAttributes} method and the file type tested with the {@link
     * BasicFileAttributes#isSymbolicLink} method.
     *
     * @param   path  The path to the file
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file is a symbolic link; {@code false} if
     *          the file does not exist, is not a symbolic link, or it cannot
     *          be determined if the file is a symbolic link or not.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file.
