     * Produces a bytecode descriptor representation of the method type.
     * <p>
     * Note that this is not a strict inverse of {@link #fromMethodDescriptorString fromMethodDescriptorString}.
     * Two distinct classes which share a common name but have different class loaders
     * will appear identical when viewed within descriptor strings.
     * <p>
     * This method is included for the benefit of applications that must
     * generate bytecodes that process method handles and {@code invokedynamic}.
     * {@link #fromMethodDescriptorString(java.lang.String, java.lang.ClassLoader) fromMethodDescriptorString},
     * because the latter requires a suitable class loader argument.
     * @return the bytecode type descriptor representation
