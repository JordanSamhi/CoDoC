     * Sets the sequence of characters to be used when determining the string
     * representation of this {@code StringJoiner} and no elements have been
     * added yet, that is, when it is empty.  A copy of the {@code emptyValue}
     * parameter is made for this purpose. Note that once an add method has been
     * called, the {@code StringJoiner} is no longer considered empty, even if
     * the element(s) added correspond to the empty {@code String}.
     *
     * @param  emptyValue the characters to return as the value of an empty
     *         {@code StringJoiner}
     * @return this {@code StringJoiner} itself so the calls may be chained
     * @throws NullPointerException when the {@code emptyValue} parameter is
     *         {@code null}
