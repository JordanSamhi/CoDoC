     * Skips over and discards <code>n</code> bytes of data from this input
     * stream. The <code>skip</code> method may, for a variety of reasons, end
     * up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly <code>0</code>.
     * This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file
     * before <code>n</code> bytes have been skipped is only one possibility.
     * The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If {@code n} is
     * negative, the {@code skip} method for class {@code InputStream} always
     * returns 0, and no bytes are skipped. Subclasses may handle the negative
     * value differently.
     *
     * <p> The <code>skip</code> method of this class creates a
     * byte array and then repeatedly reads into it until <code>n</code> bytes
     * have been read or the end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are
     * encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
     * For instance, the implementation may depend on the ability to seek.
     *
     * @param      n   the number of bytes to be skipped.
     * @return     the actual number of bytes skipped.
     * @exception  IOException  if the stream does not support seek,
     *                          or if some other I/O error occurs.
