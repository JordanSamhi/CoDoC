     * Obtains a {@code ThaiBuddhistDate} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a date in the Thai Buddhist calendar system based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code ThaiBuddhistDate}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion typically uses the {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY EPOCH_DAY}
     * field, which is standardized across calendar systems.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code ThaiBuddhistDate::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the date in Thai Buddhist calendar system, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code ThaiBuddhistDate}
