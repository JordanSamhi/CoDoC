     * <p>First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkPermission</code>
     * method is called with a <code>RuntimePermission("setIO")</code> permission
     *  to see if it's ok to reassign the "standard" error output stream.
     *
     * @param err the new standard error output stream.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *        if a security manager exists and its
     *        <code>checkPermission</code> method doesn't allow
     *        reassigning of the standard error output stream.
