     * Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
     * specified collection (optional operation).  If the specified
     * collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
     * set so that its value is the <i>asymmetric set difference</i> of
     * the two sets.
     *
     * <p>This implementation determines which is the smaller of this set
     * and the specified collection, by invoking the <tt>size</tt>
     * method on each.  If this set has fewer elements, then the
     * implementation iterates over this set, checking each element
     * returned by the iterator in turn to see if it is contained in
     * the specified collection.  If it is so contained, it is removed
     * from this set with the iterator's <tt>remove</tt> method.  If
     * the specified collection has fewer elements, then the
     * implementation iterates over the specified collection, removing
     * from this set each element returned by the iterator, using this
     * set's <tt>remove</tt> method.
     *
     * <p>Note that this implementation will throw an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the iterator returned by the
     * <tt>iterator</tt> method does not implement the <tt>remove</tt> method.
