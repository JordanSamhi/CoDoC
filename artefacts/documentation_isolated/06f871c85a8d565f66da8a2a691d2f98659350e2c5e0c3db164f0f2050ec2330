     * Does this transition represent a gap in the local time-line.
     * <p>
     * Gaps occur where there are local date-times that simply do not exist.
     * An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +01:00} to {@code +02:00}.
     * This might be described as 'the clocks will move forward one hour tonight at 1am'.
     *
     * @return true if this transition is a gap, false if it is an overlap
