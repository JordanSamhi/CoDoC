     * Generates a certificate revocation list (CRL) object and initializes it
     * with the data read from the input stream {@code inStream}.
     *
     * <p>In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
     * supported by this certificate factory,
     * the returned CRL object can be typecast to the corresponding
     * CRL class. For example, if this certificate
     * factory implements X.509 CRLs, the returned CRL object
     * can be typecast to the {@code X509CRL} class.
     *
     * <p>Note that if the given input stream does not support
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int) mark} and
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#reset() reset}, this method will
     * consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
     * method consumes one CRL and the read position of the input stream
     * is positioned to the next available byte after the inherent
     * end-of-CRL marker. If the data in the
     * input stream does not contain an inherent end-of-CRL marker (other
     * than EOF) and there is trailing data after the CRL is parsed, a
     * {@code CRLException} is thrown.
     *
     * @param inStream an input stream with the CRL data.
     *
     * @return a CRL object initialized with the data
     * from the input stream.
     *
     * @exception CRLException on parsing errors.
