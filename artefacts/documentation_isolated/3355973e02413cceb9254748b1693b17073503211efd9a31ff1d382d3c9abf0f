     * Reads up to <code>len</code> bytes of data from this input stream
     * into an array of bytes. If <code>len</code> is not zero, the method
     * blocks until some input is available; otherwise, no
     * bytes are read and <code>0</code> is returned.
     *
     * @param      b     the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @param      off   the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param      len   the maximum number of bytes read.
     * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *             <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end of
     *             the file has been reached.
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
     * <code>b.length - off</code>
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
