     * Creates a new sequential or parallel {@code LongStream} from a
     * {@code Supplier} of {@code Spliterator.OfLong}.
     *
     * <p>The {@link Supplier#get()} method will be invoked on the supplier no
     * more than once, and only after the terminal operation of the stream pipeline
     * commences.
     *
     * <p>For spliterators that report a characteristic of {@code IMMUTABLE}
     * or {@code CONCURRENT}, or that are
     * <a href="../Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a>, it is likely
     * more efficient to use {@link #longStream(java.util.Spliterator.OfLong, boolean)}
     * instead.
     * <p>The use of a {@code Supplier} in this form provides a level of
     * indirection that reduces the scope of potential interference with the
     * source.  Since the supplier is only invoked after the terminal operation
     * commences, any modifications to the source up to the start of the
     * terminal operation are reflected in the stream result.  See
     * <a href="package-summary.html#NonInterference">Non-Interference</a> for
     * more details.

     * @param supplier a {@code Supplier} of a {@code Spliterator.OfLong}
     * @param characteristics Spliterator characteristics of the supplied
     *        {@code Spliterator.OfLong}.  The characteristics must be equal to
     *        {@code supplier.get().characteristics()}, otherwise undefined
     *        behavior may occur when terminal operation commences.
     * @param parallel if {@code true} then the returned stream is a parallel
     *        stream; if {@code false} the returned stream is a sequential
     *        stream.
     * @return a new sequential or parallel {@code LongStream}
     * @see #longStream(java.util.Spliterator.OfLong, boolean)
