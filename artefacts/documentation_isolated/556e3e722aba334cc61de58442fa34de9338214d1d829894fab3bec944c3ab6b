     * Returns a copy of this {@code OffsetTime} with the specified offset ensuring
     * that the result is at the same instant on an implied day.
     * <p>
     * This method returns an object with the specified {@code ZoneOffset} and a {@code LocalTime}
     * adjusted by the difference between the two offsets.
     * This will result in the old and new objects representing the same instant on an implied day.
     * This is useful for finding the local time in a different offset.
     * For example, if this time represents {@code 10:30+02:00} and the offset specified is
     * {@code +03:00}, then this method will return {@code 11:30+03:00}.
     * <p>
     * To change the offset without adjusting the local time use {@link #withOffsetSameLocal}.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param offset  the zone offset to change to, not null
     * @return an {@code OffsetTime} based on this time with the requested offset, not null
