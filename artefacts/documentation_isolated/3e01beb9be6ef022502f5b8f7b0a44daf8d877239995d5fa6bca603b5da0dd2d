     * Returns the code point at the given index of the
     * {@code char} array. If the {@code char} value at
     * the given index in the {@code char} array is in the
     * high-surrogate range, the following index is less than the
     * length of the {@code char} array, and the
     * {@code char} value at the following index is in the
     * low-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point
     * corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise,
     * the {@code char} value at the given index is returned.
     *
     * @param a the {@code char} array
     * @param index the index to the {@code char} values (Unicode
     * code units) in the {@code char} array to be converted
     * @return the Unicode code point at the given index
     * @exception NullPointerException if {@code a} is null.
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if the value
     * {@code index} is negative or not less than
     * the length of the {@code char} array.
