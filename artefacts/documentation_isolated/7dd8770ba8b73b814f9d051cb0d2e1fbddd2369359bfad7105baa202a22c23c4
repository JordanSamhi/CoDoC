     * Combines this instant with a time-zone to create a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code ZonedDateTime} formed from this instant at the
     * specified time-zone. An exception will be thrown if the instant is too
     * large to fit into a zoned date-time.
     * <p>
     * This method is equivalent to
     * {@link ZonedDateTime#ofInstant(Instant, ZoneId) ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(this, zone)}.
     *
     * @param zone  the zone to combine with, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time formed from this instant and the specified zone, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported range
