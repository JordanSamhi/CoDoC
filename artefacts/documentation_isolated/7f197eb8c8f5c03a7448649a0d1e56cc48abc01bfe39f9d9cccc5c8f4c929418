     * Returns the host component of this URI.
     *
     * <p> The host component of a URI, if defined, will have one of the
     * following forms: </p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     *   <li><p> A domain name consisting of one or more <i>labels</i>
     *   separated by period characters ({@code '.'}), optionally followed by
     *   a period character.  Each label consists of <i>alphanum</i> characters
     *   as well as hyphen characters ({@code '-'}), though hyphens never
     *   occur as the first or last characters in a label. The rightmost
     *   label of a domain name consisting of two or more labels, begins
     *   with an <i>alpha</i> character. </li>
     *
     *   <li><p> A dotted-quad IPv4 address of the form
     *   <i>digit</i>{@code +.}<i>digit</i>{@code +.}<i>digit</i>{@code +.}<i>digit</i>{@code +},
     *   where no <i>digit</i> sequence is longer than three characters and no
     *   sequence has a value larger than 255. </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> An IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets ({@code '['} and
     *   {@code ']'}) and consisting of hexadecimal digits, colon characters
     *   ({@code ':'}), and possibly an embedded IPv4 address.  The full
     *   syntax of IPv6 addresses is specified in <a
     *   href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2373: IPv6
     *   Addressing Architecture</i></a>.  </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * The host component of a URI cannot contain escaped octets, hence this
     * method does not perform any decoding.
     *
     * @return  The host component of this URI,
     *          or {@code null} if the host is undefined
