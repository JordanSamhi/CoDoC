     * Returns a default thread factory used to create new threads.
     * This factory creates all new threads used by an Executor in the
     * same {@link ThreadGroup}. Each new
     * thread is created as a non-daemon thread with priority set to
     * the smaller of {@code Thread.NORM_PRIORITY} and the maximum
     * priority permitted in the thread group.  New threads have names
     * accessible via {@link Thread#getName} of
     * <em>pool-N-thread-M</em>, where <em>N</em> is the sequence
     * number of this factory, and <em>M</em> is the sequence number
     * of the thread created by this factory.
     * @return a thread factory
