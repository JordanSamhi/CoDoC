     * execution state if this is the {@link #commonPool()}, and no
     * additional effect if already shut down. Otherwise, tasks that
     * are in the process of being submitted or executed concurrently
     * during the course of this method may or may not be
     * rejected. This method cancels both existing and unexecuted
     * tasks, in order to permit termination in the presence of task
     * dependencies. So the method always returns an empty list
     * (unlike the case for some other Executors).
