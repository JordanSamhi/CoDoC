     * If there is a security manager set, its {@code checkConnect} method is
     * called with the local address and {@code -1} as its arguments to see
     * if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
     * an {@code InetAddress} representing the
     * {@link InetAddress#getLoopbackAddress loopback} address is returned as
