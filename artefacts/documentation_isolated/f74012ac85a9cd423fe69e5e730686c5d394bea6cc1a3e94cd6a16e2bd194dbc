         * Returns the time-to-live (TTL) value for resource bundles that
         * are loaded under this
         * <code>ResourceBundle.Control</code>. Positive time-to-live values
         * specify the number of milliseconds a bundle can remain in the
         * cache without being validated against the source data from which
         * it was constructed. The value 0 indicates that a bundle must be
         * validated each time it is retrieved from the cache. {@link
         * #TTL_DONT_CACHE} specifies that loaded resource bundles are not
         * put in the cache. {@link #TTL_NO_EXPIRATION_CONTROL} specifies
         * that loaded resource bundles are put in the cache with no
         * expiration control.
         *
         * <p>The expiration affects only the bundle loading process by the
         * <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code> factory method.  That is,
         * if the factory method finds a resource bundle in the cache that
         * has expired, the factory method calls the {@link
         * #needsReload(String, Locale, String, ClassLoader, ResourceBundle,
         * long) needsReload} method to determine whether the resource
         * bundle needs to be reloaded. If <code>needsReload</code> returns
         * <code>true</code>, the cached resource bundle instance is removed
         * from the cache. Otherwise, the instance stays in the cache,
         * updated with the new TTL value returned by this method.
         *
         * <p>All cached resource bundles are subject to removal from the
         * cache due to memory constraints of the runtime environment.
         * Returning a large positive value doesn't mean to lock loaded
         * resource bundles in the cache.
         *
         * <p>The default implementation returns {@link #TTL_NO_EXPIRATION_CONTROL}.
         *
         * @param baseName
         *        the base name of the resource bundle for which the
         *        expiration value is specified.
         * @param locale
         *        the locale of the resource bundle for which the
         *        expiration value is specified.
         * @return the time (0 or a positive millisecond offset from the
         *        cached time) to get loaded bundles expired in the cache,
         *        {@link #TTL_NO_EXPIRATION_CONTROL} to disable the
         *        expiration control, or {@link #TTL_DONT_CACHE} to disable
         *        caching.
