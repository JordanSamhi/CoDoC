     * Returns a {@code Long} object holding the value
     * of the specified {@code String}. The argument is
     * interpreted as representing a signed decimal {@code long},
     * exactly as if the argument were given to the {@link
     * #parseLong(java.lang.String)} method. The result is a
     * {@code Long} object that represents the integer value
     * specified by the string.
     *
     * <p>In other words, this method returns a {@code Long} object
     * equal to the value of:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code new Long(Long.parseLong(s))}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @param      s   the string to be parsed.
     * @return     a {@code Long} object holding the value
     *             represented by the string argument.
     * @throws     NumberFormatException  If the string cannot be parsed
     *             as a {@code long}.
