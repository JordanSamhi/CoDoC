     * Compares the specified object with this set for equality.  Returns
     * <tt>true</tt> if the given object is also a set, the two sets have
     * the same size, and every member of the given set is contained in
     * this set.  This ensures that the <tt>equals</tt> method works
     * properly across different implementations of the <tt>Set</tt>
     * interface.<p>
     *
     * This implementation first checks if the specified object is this
     * set; if so it returns <tt>true</tt>.  Then, it checks if the
     * specified object is a set whose size is identical to the size of
     * this set; if not, it returns false.  If so, it returns
     * <tt>containsAll((Collection) o)</tt>.
     *
     * @param o object to be compared for equality with this set
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the specified object is equal to this set
