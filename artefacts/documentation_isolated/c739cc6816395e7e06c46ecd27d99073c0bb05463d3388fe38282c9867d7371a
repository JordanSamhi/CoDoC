     * Sets the policy governing whether core threads may time out and
     * terminate if no tasks arrive within the keep-alive time, being
     * replaced if needed when new tasks arrive. When false, core
     * threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming
     * tasks. When true, the same keep-alive policy applying to
     * non-core threads applies also to core threads. To avoid
     * continual thread replacement, the keep-alive time must be
     * greater than zero when setting {@code true}. This method
     * should in general be called before the pool is actively used.
