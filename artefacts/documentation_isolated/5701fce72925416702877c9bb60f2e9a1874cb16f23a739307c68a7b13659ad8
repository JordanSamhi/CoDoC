     * ClassLoader is provided by the creator of the thread for use
     * by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
     * If not {@linkplain #setContextClassLoader set}, the default is the
     * ClassLoader context of the parent Thread. The context ClassLoader of the
     * primordial thread is typically set to the class loader used to load the
     * application.

     * <p>If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is not
     * {@code null} and is not the same as or an ancestor of the context class
     * loader, then this method invokes the security manager's {@link
     * SecurityManager#checkPermission(java.security.Permission) checkPermission}
     * method with a {@link RuntimePermission RuntimePermission}{@code
     * ("getClassLoader")} permission to verify that retrieval of the context
     * class loader is permitted.
     *
     * @return  the context ClassLoader for this Thread, or {@code null}
     *          indicating the system class loader (or, failing that, the
     *          bootstrap class loader)
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if the current thread cannot get the context ClassLoader
