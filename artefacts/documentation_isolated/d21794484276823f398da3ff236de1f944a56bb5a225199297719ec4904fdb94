     * Creates a new directory in the default temporary-file directory, using
     * the given prefix to generate its name. The resulting {@code Path} is
     * associated with the default {@code FileSystem}.
     *
     * <p> This method works in exactly the manner specified by {@link
     * #createTempDirectory(Path,String,FileAttribute[])} method for the case
     * that the {@code dir} parameter is the temporary-file directory.
     *
     * @param   prefix
     *          the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
     *          may be {@code null}
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the directory
     *
     * @return  the path to the newly created directory that did not exist before
     *          this method was invoked
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the prefix cannot be used to generate a candidate directory name
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the directory
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or the temporary-file directory does not
     *          exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access when creating the
     *          directory.
