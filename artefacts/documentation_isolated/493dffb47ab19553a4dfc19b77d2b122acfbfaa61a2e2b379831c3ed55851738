     * Appends a default value for a field to the formatter for use in parsing.
     * <p>
     * This appends an instruction to the builder to inject a default value
     * into the parsed result. This is especially useful in conjunction with
     * optional parts of the formatter.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a formatter that parses the year, followed by
     * an optional month, with a further optional day-of-month. Using such a
     * formatter would require the calling code to check whether a full date,
     * year-month or just a year had been parsed. This method can be used to
     * default the month and day-of-month to a sensible value, such as the
     * first of the month, allowing the calling code to always get a date.
     * <p>
     * During formatting, this method has no effect.
     * <p>
     * During parsing, the current state of the parse is inspected.
     * If the specified field has no associated value, because it has not been
     * parsed successfully at that point, then the specified value is injected
     * into the parse result. Injection is immediate, thus the field-value pair
     * will be visible to any subsequent elements in the formatter.
     * As such, this method is normally called at the end of the builder.
     *
     * @param field  the field to default the value of, not null
     * @param value  the value to default the field to
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
