     * Returns a copy of the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished
     * name in the {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
     * distinguished names. If the value returned is {@code null}, any
     * issuer distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a
     * {@code Collection} of names. Each name is a {@code String}
     * or a byte array representing a distinguished name (in RFC 2253 or
     * ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).  Note that the
     * {@code Collection} returned may contain duplicate names.
     * <p>
     * If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER
     * encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for
     * this structure is given in the documentation for
     * {@link #setIssuerNames setIssuerNames(Collection names)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that a deep copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
     * protect against subsequent modifications.
