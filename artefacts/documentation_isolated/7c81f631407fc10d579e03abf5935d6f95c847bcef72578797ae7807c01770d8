     * Reads up to {@code len} bytes of data from this file into an
     * array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte of input
     * is available.
     * <p>
     * Although {@code RandomAccessFile} is not a subclass of
     * {@code InputStream}, this method behaves in exactly the
     * same way as the {@link InputStream#read(byte[], int, int)} method of
     * {@code InputStream}.
     *
     * @param      b     the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @param      off   the start offset in array {@code b}
     *                   at which the data is written.
     * @param      len   the maximum number of bytes read.
     * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *             {@code -1} if there is no more data because the end of
     *             the file has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
     * other than end of file, or if the random access file has been closed, or if
     * some other I/O error occurs.
     * @exception  NullPointerException If {@code b} is {@code null}.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If {@code off} is negative,
     * {@code len} is negative, or {@code len} is greater than
     * {@code b.length - off}
