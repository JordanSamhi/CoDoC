     * Sets the {@link SocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} option to the
     * specified value for this {@code Socket}.
     * The {@link SocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} option is used by the
     * platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set the underlying
     * network I/O buffers.
     *
     * <p>Because {@link SocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF} is a hint,
     * applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
     * should call {@link #getSendBufferSize()}.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error
     * in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
     *
     * @param size the size to which to set the send buffer
     * size. This value must be greater than 0.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the
     * value is 0 or is negative.
