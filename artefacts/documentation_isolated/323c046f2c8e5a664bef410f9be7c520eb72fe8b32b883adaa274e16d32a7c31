     * Produces a method handle which adapts the type of the
     * given method handle to a new type by pairwise argument and return type conversion.
     * The original type and new type must have the same number of arguments.
     * The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
     * which is equal to the desired new type.
     * <p>
     * If the original type and new type are equal, returns target.
     * <p>
     * The same conversions are allowed as for {@link MethodHandle#asType MethodHandle.asType},
     * and some additional conversions are also applied if those conversions fail.
     * Given types <em>T0</em>, <em>T1</em>, one of the following conversions is applied
     * if possible, before or instead of any conversions done by {@code asType}:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are references, and <em>T1</em> is an interface type,
     *     then the value of type <em>T0</em> is passed as a <em>T1</em> without a cast.
     *     (This treatment of interfaces follows the usage of the bytecode verifier.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is boolean and <em>T1</em> is another primitive,
     *     the boolean is converted to a byte value, 1 for true, 0 for false.
     *     (This treatment follows the usage of the bytecode verifier.)
     * <li>If <em>T1</em> is boolean and <em>T0</em> is another primitive,
     *     <em>T0</em> is converted to byte via Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5),
     *     and the low order bit of the result is tested, as if by {@code (x & 1) != 0}.
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are primitives other than boolean,
     *     then a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied.
     *     (Specifically, <em>T0</em> will convert to <em>T1</em> by
     *     widening and/or narrowing.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a reference and <em>T1</em> a primitive, an unboxing
     *     conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
     *     by a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) on the primitive value,
     *     possibly followed by a conversion from byte to boolean by testing
     *     the low-order bit.
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a reference and <em>T1</em> a primitive,
     *     and if the reference is null at runtime, a zero value is introduced.
     * </ul>
     * @param target the method handle to invoke after arguments are retyped
     * @param newType the expected type of the new method handle
     * @return a method handle which delegates to the target after performing
     *           any necessary argument conversions, and arranges for any
     *           necessary return value conversions
     * @throws NullPointerException if either argument is null
     * @throws WrongMethodTypeException if the conversion cannot be made
