     * <a href="Pattern.html#groupname">named-capturing group</a> during the previous
     * match operation.
     *
     * <p> If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
     * any part of the input sequence, then <tt>null</tt> is returned. Note
     * that some groups, for example <tt>(a*)</tt>, match the empty string.
     * This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
     * matches the empty string in the input.  </p>

     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          If no match has yet been attempted,
