     * Returns a {@code Boolean} instance representing the specified
     * {@code boolean} value.  If the specified {@code boolean} value
     * is {@code true}, this method returns {@code Boolean.TRUE};
     * if it is {@code false}, this method returns {@code Boolean.FALSE}.
     * If a new {@code Boolean} instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Boolean(boolean)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance.
