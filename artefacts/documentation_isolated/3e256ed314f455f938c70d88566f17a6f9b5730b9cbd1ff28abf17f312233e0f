     * Parses the string argument as an unsigned decimal {@code long}. The
     * characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except
     * that the first character may be an an ASCII plus sign {@code
     * '+'} ({@code '\u005Cu002B'}). The resulting integer value
     * is returned, exactly as if the argument and the radix 10 were
     * given as arguments to the {@link

     * @param s   a {@code String} containing the unsigned {@code long}

     * @throws    NumberFormatException  if the string does not contain a
     *            parsable unsigned integer.
