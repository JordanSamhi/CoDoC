     * Returns a {@code Type} object that represents the declared type for
     * the field represented by this {@code Field} object.
     *
     * <p>If the {@code Type} is a parameterized type, the
     * {@code Type} object returned must accurately reflect the
     * actual type parameters used in the source code.
     *
     * <p>If the type of the underlying field is a type variable or a
     * parameterized type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.
