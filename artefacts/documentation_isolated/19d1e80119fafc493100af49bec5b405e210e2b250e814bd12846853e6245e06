     * Converts the object to a string. The string representation is the
     * string "class" or "interface", followed by a space, and then by the
     * fully qualified name of the class in the format returned by
     * {@code getName}.  If this {@code Class} object represents a
     * primitive type, this method returns the name of the primitive type.  If
     * this {@code Class} object represents void this method returns
     * "void".
     *
