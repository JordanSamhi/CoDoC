     * or {@linkplain #setSubject(byte[])} instead. This method should not be

     * Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name
     * must match the subject distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509Certificate}. If {@code null}, any subject
     * distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If {@code subjectDN} is not {@code null}, it should contain a
     * distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

     * @param subjectDN a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
     *                  (or {@code null})
