     * Returns a copy of the subjectAlternativeNames criterion.
     * The {@code X509Certificate} must contain all or at least one
     * of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value
     * of the matchAllNames flag (see {@link #getMatchAllSubjectAltNames
     * getMatchAllSubjectAltNames}). If the value returned is
     * {@code null}, no subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed.
     * <p>
     * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a
     * {@code Collection} with
     * one entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name
     * criterion. Each entry is a {@code List} whose first entry is an
     * {@code Integer} (the name type, 0-8) and whose second
     * entry is a {@code String} or a byte array (the name, in
     * string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
     * There can be multiple names of the same type.  Note that the
     * {@code Collection} returned may contain duplicate names (same name
     * and name type).
     * <p>
     * Each subject alternative name in the {@code Collection}
     * may be specified either as a {@code String} or as an ASN.1 encoded
     * byte array. For more details about the formats used, see
     * {@link #addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)
     * addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name)} and
     * {@link #addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)
     * addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that a deep copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
     * protect against subsequent modifications.
