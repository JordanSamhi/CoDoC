     * <p>
     * The day-of-year in this factory is expressed relative to the start of the year-of-era.
     * This definition changes the normal meaning of day-of-year only in those years
     * where the year-of-era is reset to one due to a change in the era.
     * For example:
     * <pre>
     *  6th Jan Showa 64 = day-of-year 6
     *  7th Jan Showa 64 = day-of-year 7
     *  8th Jan Heisei 1 = day-of-year 1
     *  9th Jan Heisei 1 = day-of-year 2
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param era  the Japanese era, not null
     * @param yearOfEra  the year-of-era
     * @param dayOfYear  the day-of-year
     * @return the Japanese local date, not null
