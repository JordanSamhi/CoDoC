     * Write lines of text to a file. Each line is a char sequence and is
     * written to the file in sequence with each line terminated by the
     * platform's line separator, as defined by the system property {@code
     * line.separator}. Characters are encoded into bytes using the specified
     * charset.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter specifies how the the file is created
     * or opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the
     * {@link StandardOpenOption#CREATE CREATE}, {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING}, and {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#WRITE WRITE} options are present. In other words, it
     * opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
     * initially truncating an existing {@link #isRegularFile regular-file} to
     * a size of {@code 0}. The method ensures that the file is closed when all
     * lines have been written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is
     * thrown). If an I/O error occurs then it may do so after the file has
     * created or truncated, or after some bytes have been written to the file.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   lines
     *          an object to iterate over the char sequences
     * @param   cs
     *          the charset to use for encoding
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  the path
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs writing to or creating the file, or the
     *          text cannot be encoded using the specified charset
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
