     * Obtains an instance of {@code OffsetDateTime} from a year, month, day,
     * hour, minute, second, nanosecond and offset.
     * <p>
     * This creates an offset date-time with the seven specified fields.
     * <p>
     * This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
     * Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.
     * {@code LocalDateTime} has five additional convenience variants of the
     * equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
     * They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.
     *
     * @param year  the year to represent, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR

     * @param second  the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
     * @param nanoOfSecond  the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
     * @param offset  the zone offset, not null
     * @return the offset date-time, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the value of any field is out of range, or
