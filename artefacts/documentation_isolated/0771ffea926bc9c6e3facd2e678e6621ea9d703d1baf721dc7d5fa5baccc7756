     * Returns the character offset in the original text corresponding to the next
     * collation element.  (That is, getOffset() returns the position in the text
     * corresponding to the collation element that will be returned by the next
     * call to next().)  This value will always be the index of the FIRST character
     * corresponding to the collation element (a contracting character sequence is
     * when two or more characters all correspond to the same collation element).
     * This means if you do setOffset(x) followed immediately by getOffset(), getOffset()
     * won't necessarily return x.

     * @return The character offset in the original text corresponding to the collation
     * element that will be returned by the next call to next().
