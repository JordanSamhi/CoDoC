     * Returns the root node of the valid policy tree resulting from the
     * PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The
     * {@code PolicyNode} object that is returned and any objects that
     * it returns through public methods are immutable.
     *
     * <p>Most applications will not need to examine the valid policy tree.
     * They can achieve their policy processing goals by setting the
     * policy-related parameters in {@code PKIXParameters}. However, more
     * sophisticated applications, especially those that process policy
     * qualifiers, may need to traverse the valid policy tree using the
     * {@link PolicyNode#getParent PolicyNode.getParent} and
     * {@link PolicyNode#getChildren PolicyNode.getChildren} methods.
     *
     * @return the root node of the valid policy tree, or {@code null}
     * if there are no valid policies
