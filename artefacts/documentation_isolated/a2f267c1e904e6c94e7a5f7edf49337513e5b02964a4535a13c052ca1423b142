     * Returns a field to access the day of week based on this {@code WeekFields}.
     * <p>
     * This is similar to {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} but uses values for
     * the day-of-week based on this {@code WeekFields}.
     * The days are numbered from 1 to 7 where the
     * {@link #getFirstDayOfWeek() first day-of-week} is assigned the value 1.
     * <p>
     * For example, if the first day-of-week is Sunday, then that will have the
     * value 1, with other days ranging from Monday as 2 to Saturday as 7.
     * <p>
     * In the resolving phase of parsing, a localized day-of-week will be converted
     * to a standardized {@code ChronoField} day-of-week.
     * The day-of-week must be in the valid range 1 to 7.
     * Other fields in this class build dates using the standardized day-of-week.
     *
     * @return a field providing access to the day-of-week with localized numbering, not null
