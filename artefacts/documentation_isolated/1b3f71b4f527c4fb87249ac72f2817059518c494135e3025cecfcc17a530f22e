     * Reads a signed eight-bit value from this file. This method reads a
     * byte from the file, starting from the current file pointer.
     * If the byte read is {@code b}, where
     * <code>0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;b&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;255</code>,
     * then the result is:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     (byte)(b)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the byte is read, the end of the stream
     * is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next byte of this file as a signed eight-bit
     *             {@code byte}.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file has reached the end.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
