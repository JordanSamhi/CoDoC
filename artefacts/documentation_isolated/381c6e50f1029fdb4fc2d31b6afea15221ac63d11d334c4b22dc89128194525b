     * Returns an input stream for this socket.
     *
     * <p> If this socket has an associated channel then the resulting input
     * stream delegates all of its operations to the channel.  If the channel
     * is in non-blocking mode then the input stream's {@code read} operations
     * will throw an {@link java.nio.channels.IllegalBlockingModeException}.
     *
     * <p>Under abnormal conditions the underlying connection may be
     * broken by the remote host or the network software (for example
     * a connection reset in the case of TCP connections). When a
     * broken connection is detected by the network software the
     * following applies to the returned input stream :-
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     *   <li><p>The network software may discard bytes that are buffered
     *   by the socket. Bytes that aren't discarded by the network
     *   software can be read using {@link java.io.InputStream#read read}.
     *
     *   <li><p>If there are no bytes buffered on the socket, or all
     *   buffered bytes have been consumed by
     *   {@link java.io.InputStream#read read}, then all subsequent
     *   calls to {@link java.io.InputStream#read read} will throw an
     *   {@link java.io.IOException IOException}.
     *
     *   <li><p>If there are no bytes buffered on the socket, and the
     *   socket has not been closed using {@link #close close}, then
     *   {@link java.io.InputStream#available available} will
     *   return {@code 0}.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> Closing the returned {@link java.io.InputStream InputStream}
     * will close the associated socket.
     *
     * @return     an input stream for reading bytes from this socket.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs when creating the
     *             input stream, the socket is closed, the socket is
     *             not connected, or the socket input has been shutdown
     *             using {@link #shutdownInput()}
