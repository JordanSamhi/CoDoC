     * Returns a {@code Short} object holding the value
     * extracted from the specified {@code String} when parsed
     * with the radix given by the second argument. The first argument
     * is interpreted as representing a signed {@code short} in
     * the radix specified by the second argument, exactly as if the
     * argument were given to the {@link #parseShort(java.lang.String,
     * int)} method. The result is a {@code Short} object that
     * represents the {@code short} value specified by the string.
     *
     * <p>In other words, this method returns a {@code Short} object
     * equal to the value of:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code new Short(Short.parseShort(s, radix))}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @param s         the string to be parsed
     * @param radix     the radix to be used in interpreting {@code s}
     * @return          a {@code Short} object holding the value
     *                  represented by the string argument in the
     *                  specified radix.
     * @throws          NumberFormatException If the {@code String} does
     *                  not contain a parsable {@code short}.
