     * so long as the original abstract pathname, the URI, and the new abstract
     * pathname are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
     * Java virtual machine.  Due to the system-dependent nature of abstract
     * pathnames, however, this relationship typically does not hold when a
     * <tt>file:</tt> URI that is created in a virtual machine on one operating
     * system is converted into an abstract pathname in a virtual machine on a
     * different operating system.

     * <p> Note that when this abstract pathname represents a UNC pathname then
     * all components of the UNC (including the server name component) are encoded
     * in the {@code URI} path. The authority component is undefined, meaning
     * that it is represented as {@code null}. The {@link Path} class defines the
     * {@link Path#toUri toUri} method to encode the server name in the authority
     * component of the resulting {@code URI}. The {@link #toPath toPath} method
     * may be used to obtain a {@code Path} representing this abstract pathname.
