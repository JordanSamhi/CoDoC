     * Returns the default {@code FileSystem}. The default file system creates
     * objects that provide access to the file systems accessible to the Java
     * virtual machine. The <em>working directory</em> of the file system is
     * the current user directory, named by the system property {@code user.dir}.
     * This allows for interoperability with the {@link java.io.File java.io.File}
     * class.
     *
     * <p> The first invocation of any of the methods defined by this class
     * locates the default {@link FileSystemProvider provider} object. Where the
     * system property {@code java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is
     * not defined then the default provider is a system-default provider that
     * is invoked to create the default file system.
     *
     * <p> If the system property {@code java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider}
     * is defined then it is taken to be a list of one or more fully-qualified
     * names of concrete provider classes identified by the URI scheme
     * {@code "file"}. Where the property is a list of more than one name then
     * the names are separated by a comma. Each class is loaded, using the system
     * class loader, and instantiated by invoking a one argument constructor
     * whose formal parameter type is {@code FileSystemProvider}. The providers
     * are loaded and instantiated in the order they are listed in the property.
     * If this process fails or a provider's scheme is not equal to {@code "file"}
     * then an unspecified error is thrown. URI schemes are normally compared
     * without regard to case but for the default provider, the scheme is
     * required to be {@code "file"}. The first provider class is instantiated
     * by invoking it with a reference to the system-default provider.
     * The second provider class is instantiated by invoking it with a reference
     * to the first provider instance. The third provider class is instantiated
     * by invoking it with a reference to the second instance, and so on. The
     * last provider to be instantiated becomes the default provider; its {@code
     * getFileSystem} method is invoked with the URI {@code "file:///"} to
     * get a reference to the default file system.
     *
     * <p> Subsequent invocations of this method return the file system that was
     * returned by the first invocation.
     *
     * @return  the default file system
