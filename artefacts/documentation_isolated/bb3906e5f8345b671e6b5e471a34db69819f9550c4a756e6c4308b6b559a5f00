     * Gets the current millisecond instant of the clock.
     * <p>
     * This returns the millisecond-based instant, measured from 1970-01-01T00:00Z (UTC).
     * This is equivalent to the definition of {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}.
     * <p>
     * Most applications should avoid this method and use {@link Instant} to represent
     * an instant on the time-line rather than a raw millisecond value.
     * This method is provided to allow the use of the clock in high performance use cases
     * where the creation of an object would be unacceptable.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation currently calls {@link #instant}.
     *
     * @return the current millisecond instant from this clock, measured from
     *  the Java epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00Z (UTC), not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the instant cannot be obtained, not thrown by most implementations
