     * Obtains an instance of {@code MonthDay}.
     * <p>
     * The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.
     * Hence, for February, day 29 is valid.
     * <p>
     * For example, passing in April and day 31 will throw an exception, as
     * there can never be April 31st in any year. By contrast, passing in
     * February 29th is permitted, as that month-day can sometimes be valid.

     * @param month  the month-of-year to represent, not null

     * @return the month-day, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the value of any field is out of range,
     *  or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month
