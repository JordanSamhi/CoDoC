     * When a TCP connection is closed the connection may remain
     * in a timeout state for a period of time after the connection
     * is closed (typically known as the {@code TIME_WAIT} state
     * or {@code 2MSL} wait state).
     * For applications using a well known socket address or port
     * it may not be possible to bind a socket to the required
     * {@code SocketAddress} if there is a connection in the
     * timeout state involving the socket address or port.
     * <p>
     * Enabling {@link SocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} prior to
     * binding the socket using {@link #bind(SocketAddress)} allows the socket
     * to be bound even though a previous connection is in a timeout state.
     * <p>
     * When a {@code ServerSocket} is created the initial setting
     * of {@link SocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} is not defined.
     * Applications can use {@link #getReuseAddress()} to determine the initial
     * setting of {@link SocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR}.
     * <p>
     * The behaviour when {@link SocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} is
     * enabled or disabled after a socket is bound (See {@link #isBound()})
     * is not defined.
