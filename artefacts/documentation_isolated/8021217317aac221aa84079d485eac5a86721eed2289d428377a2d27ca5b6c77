     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified list.
     * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in
     * an immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a list contains
     * no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe
     * view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the list
     * takes place through the view, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the
     * list cannot contain an incorrectly typed element.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
     * checkedCollection} method.
     *
     * <p>The returned list will be serializable if the specified list
     * is serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned list permits insertion of null elements whenever
     * the backing list does.
