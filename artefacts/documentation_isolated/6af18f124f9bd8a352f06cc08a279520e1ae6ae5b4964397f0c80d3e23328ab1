     * This returns the zone ID. This identifies the time-zone {@link ZoneRules rules}
     * that determine when and how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes.
     * <p>
     * The zone ID may be same as the {@linkplain #getOffset() offset}.
     * If this is true, then any future calculations, such as addition or subtraction,
     * have no complex edge cases due to time-zone rules.
