     * Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
     * effort toward running the <code>finalize</code> methods of objects
     * that have been found to be discarded but whose <code>finalize</code>
     * methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
     * method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to
     * complete all outstanding finalizations.
     * <p>
     * The call <code>System.runFinalization()</code> is effectively
     * equivalent to the call:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization()
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @see     java.lang.Runtime#runFinalization()
