     * This creates an offset time with the four specified fields.
     * <p>
     * This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
     * Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.
     * {@code LocalTime} has two additional convenience variants of the
     * equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
     * They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.
