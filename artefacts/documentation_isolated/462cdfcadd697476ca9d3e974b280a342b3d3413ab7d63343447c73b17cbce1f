     * Returns an array containing {@code Method} objects reflecting all the
     * public methods of the class or interface represented by this {@code
     * Class} object, including those declared by the class or interface and
     * those inherited from superclasses and superinterfaces.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a type that has multiple
     * public methods with the same name and parameter types, but different
     * return types, then the returned array has a {@code Method} object for
     * each such method.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a type with a class
     * initialization method {@code <clinit>}, then the returned array does
     * <em>not</em> have a corresponding {@code Method} object.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an array type, then the
     * returned array has a {@code Method} object for each of the public
     * methods inherited by the array type from {@code Object}. It does not
     * contain a {@code Method} object for {@code clone()}.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an interface then the
     * returned array does not contain any implicitly declared methods from
     * {@code Object}. Therefore, if no methods are explicitly declared in
     * this interface or any of its superinterfaces then the returned array
     * has length 0. (Note that a {@code Class} object which represents a class
     * always has public methods, inherited from {@code Object}.)
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a primitive type or void,
     * then the returned array has length 0.
     *
     * <p> Static methods declared in superinterfaces of the class or interface
     * represented by this {@code Class} object are not considered members of
     * the class or interface.
     *
     * <p> The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any
     * particular order.
