     * Read an object from the ObjectInputStream.  The class of the object, the
     * signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and
     * non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read.
     * Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject
     * and readObject methods.  Objects referenced by this object are read
     * transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is
     * reconstructed by readObject.
     *
     * <p>The root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the
     * objects it references are completely restored.  At this point the object
     * validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered
     * priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject
     * special methods) as they are individually restored.
     *
     * <p>Exceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for
     * classes that should not be deserialized.  All exceptions are fatal to
     * the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the
     * caller to ignore or recover the stream state.
     *
     * @throws  ClassNotFoundException Class of a serialized object cannot be
     *          found.
     * @throws  InvalidClassException Something is wrong with a class used by
     *          serialization.
     * @throws  StreamCorruptedException Control information in the
     *          stream is inconsistent.
     * @throws  OptionalDataException Primitive data was found in the
     *          stream instead of objects.
     * @throws  IOException Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.
