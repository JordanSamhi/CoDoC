     * Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value
     * according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double
     * format" bit layout.
     *
     * <p>Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x8000000000000000L}) represents the sign of the
     * floating-point number. Bits
     * 62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x7ff0000000000000L}) represent the exponent. Bits 51-0
     * (the bits that are selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x000fffffffffffffL}) represent the significand
     * (sometimes called the mantissa) of the floating-point number.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
     * {@code 0x7ff0000000000000L}.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
     * {@code 0xfff0000000000000L}.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is NaN, the result is
     * {@code 0x7ff8000000000000L}.
     *
     * <p>In all cases, the result is a {@code long} integer that, when
     * given to the {@link #longBitsToDouble(long)} method, will produce a
     * floating-point value the same as the argument to
     * {@code doubleToLongBits} (except all NaN values are
     * collapsed to a single "canonical" NaN value).
     *
     * @param   value   a {@code double} precision floating-point number.
     * @return the bits that represent the floating-point number.
