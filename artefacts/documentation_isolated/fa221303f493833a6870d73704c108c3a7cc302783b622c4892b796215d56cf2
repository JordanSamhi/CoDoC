     * Returns {@code f} &times;
     * 2<sup>{@code scaleFactor}</sup> rounded as if performed
     * by a single correctly rounded floating-point multiply to a
     * member of the float value set.  See the Java
     * Language Specification for a discussion of floating-point
     * value sets.  If the exponent of the result is between {@link
     * Float#MIN_EXPONENT} and {@link Float#MAX_EXPONENT}, the
     * answer is calculated exactly.  If the exponent of the result
     * would be larger than {@code Float.MAX_EXPONENT}, an
     * infinity is returned.  Note that if the result is subnormal,
     * precision may be lost; that is, when {@code scalb(x, n)}
     * is subnormal, {@code scalb(scalb(x, n), -n)} may not equal
     * <i>x</i>.  When the result is non-NaN, the result has the same
     * sign as {@code f}.
     *
     * <p>Special cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li> If the first argument is NaN, NaN is returned.
     * <li> If the first argument is infinite, then an infinity of the
     * same sign is returned.
     * <li> If the first argument is zero, then a zero of the same
     * sign is returned.
     * </ul>
