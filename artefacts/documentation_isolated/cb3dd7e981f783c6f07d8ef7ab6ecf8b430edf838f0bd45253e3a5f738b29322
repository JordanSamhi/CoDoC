     * Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
     * {@code long} value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
     * There is one special case, if the dividend is the
     * {@linkplain Long#MIN_VALUE Long.MIN_VALUE} and the divisor is {@code -1},
     * then integer overflow occurs and
     * the result is equal to the {@code Long.MIN_VALUE}.
     * <p>
     * Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
     * (truncation).  This operation instead acts under the round toward
     * negative infinity (floor) rounding mode.
     * The floor rounding mode gives different results than truncation
     * when the exact result is negative.
     * <p>
     * For examples, see {@link #floorDiv(int, int)}.
