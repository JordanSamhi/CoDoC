     * Converts the character argument to uppercase using case mapping
     * information from the UnicodeData file.
     * <p>
     * Note that
     * {@code Character.isUpperCase(Character.toUpperCase(ch))}
     * does not always return {@code true} for some ranges of
     * characters, particularly those that are symbols or ideographs.
     *
     * <p>In general, {@link String#toUpperCase()} should be used to map
     * characters to uppercase. {@code String} case mapping methods
     * have several benefits over {@code Character} case mapping methods.
     * {@code String} case mapping methods can perform locale-sensitive
     * mappings, context-sensitive mappings, and 1:M character mappings, whereas
     * the {@code Character} case mapping methods cannot.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a
     * href="#supplementary"> supplementary characters</a>. To support
     * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
     * the {@link #toUpperCase(int)} method.
     *
     * @param   ch   the character to be converted.
     * @return  the uppercase equivalent of the character, if any;
     *          otherwise, the character itself.
