     * Set whether a subscription is opportunistic, that is, whether the network it connects
     * to has limited coverage. For example, CBRS. Setting a subscription opportunistic has
     * following impacts:
     *  1) Even if it's active, it will be dormant most of the time. The modem will not try
     *     to scan or camp until it knows an available network is nearby to save power.
     *  2) Telephony relies on system app or carrier input to notify nearby available networks.
     *     See {@link TelephonyManager#updateAvailableNetworks(List, Executor, Consumer)}
     *     for more information.
     *  3) In multi-SIM devices, when the network is nearby and camped, system may automatically
     *     switch internet data between it and default data subscription, based on carrier
     *     recommendation and its signal strength and metered-ness, etc.
     *
     *
     * Caller will either have {@link android.Manifest.permission#MODIFY_PHONE_STATE} or carrier
     * privilege permission of the subscription.
     *
     * @param opportunistic whether it’s opportunistic subscription.
     * @param subId the unique SubscriptionInfo index in database
     * @return {@code true} if the operation is succeed, {@code false} otherwise.
