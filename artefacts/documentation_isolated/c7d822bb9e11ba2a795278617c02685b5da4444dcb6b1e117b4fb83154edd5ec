     * Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code long}
     * value from this random number generator's sequence. The general
     * contract of {@code nextLong} is that one {@code long} value is
     * pseudorandomly generated and returned.
     *
     * <p>The method {@code nextLong} is implemented by class {@code Random}
     * as if by:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * public long nextLong() {
     *   return ((long)next(32) << 32) + next(32);
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * Because class {@code Random} uses a seed with only 48 bits,
     * this algorithm will not return all possible {@code long} values.
     *
     * @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code long}
     *         value from this random number generator's sequence
