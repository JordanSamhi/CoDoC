     * Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link StandardOpenOption#WRITE
     * WRITE} options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
     * writing. If neither option (or the {@link StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND}
     * option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
     * By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.
     *
     * <p> In the addition to {@code READ} and {@code WRITE}, the following
     * options may be present:
