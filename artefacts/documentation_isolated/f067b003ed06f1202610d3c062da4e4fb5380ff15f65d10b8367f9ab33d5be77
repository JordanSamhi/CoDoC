     * Writes bytes to a file. The {@code options} parameter specifies how the
     * the file is created or opened. If no options are present then this method
     * works as if the {@link StandardOpenOption#CREATE CREATE}, {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING}, and {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#WRITE WRITE} options are present. In other words, it
     * opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
     * initially truncating an existing {@link #isRegularFile regular-file} to
     * a size of {@code 0}. All bytes in the byte array are written to the file.
     * The method ensures that the file is closed when all bytes have been
     * written (or an I/O error or other runtime exception is thrown). If an I/O
     * error occurs then it may do so after the file has created or truncated,
     * or after some bytes have been written to the file.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage example</b>: By default the method creates a new file or
     * overwrites an existing file. Suppose you instead want to append bytes
     * to an existing file:
     * <pre>
     *     Path path = ...
     *     byte[] bytes = ...
     *     Files.write(path, bytes, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   bytes
     *          the byte array with the bytes to write
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  the path
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs writing to or creating the file
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
