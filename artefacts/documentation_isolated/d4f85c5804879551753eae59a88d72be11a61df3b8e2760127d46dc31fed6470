     * Returns a view of a {@link Deque} as a Last-in-first-out (Lifo)
     * {@link Queue}. Method <tt>add</tt> is mapped to <tt>push</tt>,
     * <tt>remove</tt> is mapped to <tt>pop</tt> and so on. This
     * view can be useful when you would like to use a method
     * requiring a <tt>Queue</tt> but you need Lifo ordering.
     *
     * <p>Each method invocation on the queue returned by this method
     * results in exactly one method invocation on the backing deque, with
     * one exception.  The {@link Queue#addAll addAll} method is
     * implemented as a sequence of {@link Deque#addFirst addFirst}
     * invocations on the backing deque.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the deque
     * @param deque the deque
     * @return the queue
