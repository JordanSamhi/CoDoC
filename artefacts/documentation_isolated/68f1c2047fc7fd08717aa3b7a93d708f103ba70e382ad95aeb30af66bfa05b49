     * Performs a timed {@link Object#wait(long, int) Object.wait}
     * using this time unit.
     * This is a convenience method that converts timeout arguments
     * into the form required by the {@code Object.wait} method.
     *
     * <p>For example, you could implement a blocking {@code poll}
     * method (see {@link BlockingQueue#poll BlockingQueue.poll})
     * using:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * public synchronized Object poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
     *     throws InterruptedException {
     *   while (empty) {
     *     unit.timedWait(this, timeout);
     *     ...
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @param obj the object to wait on
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait. If less than
     * or equal to zero, do not wait at all.
     * @throws InterruptedException if interrupted while waiting
