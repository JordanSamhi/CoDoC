     * Creates a symbolic link to a target <i>(optional operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> The {@code target} parameter is the target of the link. It may be an
     * {@link Path#isAbsolute absolute} or relative path and may not exist. When
     * the target is a relative path then file system operations on the resulting
     * link are relative to the path of the link.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is optional {@link FileAttribute
     * attributes} to set atomically when creating the link. Each attribute is
     * identified by its {@link FileAttribute#name name}. If more than one attribute
     * of the same name is included in the array then all but the last occurrence
     * is ignored.
     *
     * <p> Where symbolic links are supported, but the underlying {@link FileStore}
     * does not support symbolic links, then this may fail with an {@link
     * IOException}. Additionally, some operating systems may require that the
     * Java virtual machine be started with implementation specific privileges to
     * create symbolic links, in which case this method may throw {@code IOException}.
     *
     * @param   link
     *          the path of the symbolic link to create
     * @param   target
     *          the target of the symbolic link
     * @param   attrs
     *          the array of attributes to set atomically when creating the
     *          symbolic link
     *
     * @return  the path to the symbolic link
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the implementation does not support symbolic links or the
     *          array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically when
     *          creating the symbolic link
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if a file with the name already exists <i>(optional specific
     *          exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
     *          is installed, it denies {@link LinkPermission}<tt>("symbolic")</tt>
     *          or its {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method denies write access to the path of the symbolic link.
