     * Refreshes the rules from the underlying data provider.
     * <p>
     * This method allows an application to request that the providers check
     * for any updates to the provided rules.
     * After calling this method, the offset stored in any {@link ZonedDateTime}
     * may be invalid for the zone ID.
     * <p>
     * Dynamic update of rules is a complex problem and most applications
     * should not use this method or dynamic rules.
     * To achieve dynamic rules, a provider implementation will have to be written
     * as per the specification of this class.
     * In addition, instances of {@code ZoneRules} must not be cached in the
     * application as they will become stale. However, the boolean flag on
     * {@link #provideRules(String, boolean)} allows provider implementations
     * to control the caching of {@code ZoneId}, potentially ensuring that
     * all objects in the system see the new rules.
     * Note that there is likely to be a cost in performance of a dynamic rules
     * provider. Note also that no dynamic rules provider is in this specification.
     *
     * @return true if the rules were updated
     * @throws ZoneRulesException if an error occurs during the refresh
