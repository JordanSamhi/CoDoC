     * Retrieves a set of file descriptors that a peer has sent through
     * an ancillary message. This method retrieves the most recent set sent,
     * and then returns null until a new set arrives.
     * File descriptors may only be passed along with regular data, so this
     * method can only return a non-null after a read operation.
     *
     * @return null or file descriptor array
     * @throws IOException
