     * Constructs a sorted map from canonical charset names to charset objects.
     *
     * <p> The map returned by this method will have one entry for each charset
     * for which support is available in the current Java virtual machine.  If
     * two or more supported charsets have the same canonical name then the
     * resulting map will contain just one of them; which one it will contain
     * is not specified. </p>
     *
     * <p> The invocation of this method, and the subsequent use of the
     * resulting map, may cause time-consuming disk or network I/O operations
     * to occur.  This method is provided for applications that need to
     * enumerate all of the available charsets, for example to allow user
     * charset selection.  This method is not used by the {@link #forName
     * forName} method, which instead employs an efficient incremental lookup
     * algorithm.
     *
     * <p> This method may return different results at different times if new
     * charset providers are dynamically made available to the current Java
     * virtual machine.  In the absence of such changes, the charsets returned
     * by this method are exactly those that can be retrieved via the {@link
     * #forName forName} method.  </p>
     *
     * @return An immutable, case-insensitive map from canonical charset names
     *         to charset objects
