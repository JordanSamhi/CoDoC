     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
     * symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
     * of the link is read. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS
     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   options
     *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
     *
     * @return  a {@code FileTime} representing the time the file was last
     *          modified, or an implementation specific default when a time
     *          stamp to indicate the time of last modification is not supported
     *          by the file system
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file.
