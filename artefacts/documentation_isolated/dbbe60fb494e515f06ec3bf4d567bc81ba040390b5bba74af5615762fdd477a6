     *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          read access if the file is opened for reading. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          write access if the file is opened for writing
