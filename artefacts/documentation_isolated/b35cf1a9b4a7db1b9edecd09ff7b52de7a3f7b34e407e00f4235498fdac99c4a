     * Returns a hash code based on the "deep contents" of the specified
     * array.  If the array contains other arrays as elements, the
     * hash code is based on their contents and so on, ad infinitum.
     * It is therefore unacceptable to invoke this method on an array that
     * contains itself as an element, either directly or indirectly through
     * one or more levels of arrays.  The behavior of such an invocation is
     * undefined.
     *
     * <p>For any two arrays <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> such that
     * <tt>Arrays.deepEquals(a, b)</tt>, it is also the case that
     * <tt>Arrays.deepHashCode(a) == Arrays.deepHashCode(b)</tt>.
     *
     * <p>The computation of the value returned by this method is similar to
     * that of the value returned by {@link List#hashCode()} on a list
     * containing the same elements as <tt>a</tt> in the same order, with one
     * difference: If an element <tt>e</tt> of <tt>a</tt> is itself an array,
     * its hash code is computed not by calling <tt>e.hashCode()</tt>, but as
     * by calling the appropriate overloading of <tt>Arrays.hashCode(e)</tt>
     * if <tt>e</tt> is an array of a primitive type, or as by calling
     * <tt>Arrays.deepHashCode(e)</tt> recursively if <tt>e</tt> is an array
     * of a reference type.  If <tt>a</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, this method
     * returns 0.
