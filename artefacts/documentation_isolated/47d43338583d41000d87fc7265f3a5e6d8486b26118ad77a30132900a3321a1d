    * Generates a hash code for a sequence of input values. The hash
    * code is generated as if all the input values were placed into an
    * array, and that array were hashed by calling {@link
    * Arrays#hashCode(Object[])}.
    *
    * <p>This method is useful for implementing {@link
    * Object#hashCode()} on objects containing multiple fields. For
    * example, if an object that has three fields, {@code x}, {@code
    * y}, and {@code z}, one could write:
    *
    * <blockquote><pre>
    * &#064;Override public int hashCode() {
    *     return Objects.hash(x, y, z);
    * }
    * </pre></blockquote>
    *
    * <b>Warning: When a single object reference is supplied, the returned
    * value does not equal the hash code of that object reference.</b> This
    * value can be computed by calling {@link #hashCode(Object)}.
    *
    * @param values the values to be hashed
    * @return a hash value of the sequence of input values
    * @see Arrays#hashCode(Object[])
    * @see List#hashCode
