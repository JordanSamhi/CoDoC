     * and only if a file with this name does not yet exist.  The check for the
     * existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
     * are a single operation that is atomic with respect to all other
     * filesystem activities that might affect the file.

     * Note: this method should <i>not</i> be used for file-locking, as
     * the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The
     * {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock FileLock}
     * facility should be used instead.
