     * <p> Depending on the specification of <tt>toString</tt> for the
     * character sequence <tt>csq</tt>, the entire sequence may not be
     * appended. For instance, invoking the <tt>toString</tt> method of a
     * character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon
     * the buffer's position and limit.
     *
     * @param  csq
     *         The character sequence to append.  If <tt>csq</tt> is
     *         <tt>null</tt>, then the four characters <tt>"null"</tt> are
     *         appended to this writer.
