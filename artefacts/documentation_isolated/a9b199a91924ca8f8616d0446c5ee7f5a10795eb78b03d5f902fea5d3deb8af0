     * Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.
     * Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend
     * effort toward running the <code>finalize</code> methods of objects
     * that have been found to be discarded but whose <code>finalize</code>
     * methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
     * method call, the virtual machine has made a best effort to
     * complete all outstanding finalizations.
     * <p>
     * The virtual machine performs the finalization process
     * automatically as needed, in a separate thread, if the
     * <code>runFinalization</code> method is not invoked explicitly.
     * <p>
     * The method {@link System#runFinalization()} is the conventional
     * and convenient means of invoking this method.
