    * Returns the error stream if the connection failed
    * but the server sent useful data nonetheless. The
    * typical example is when an HTTP server responds
    * with a 404, which will cause a FileNotFoundException
    * to be thrown in connect, but the server sent an HTML
    * help page with suggestions as to what to do.
    *
    * <p>This method will not cause a connection to be initiated.  If
    * the connection was not connected, or if the server did not have
    * an error while connecting or if the server had an error but
    * no error data was sent, this method will return null. This is
    * the default.
    *
    * @return an error stream if any, null if there have been no
    * errors, the connection is not connected or the server sent no
    * useful data.
