     * Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its
     * shutdown sequence.  This method never returns normally.  The argument
     * serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates
     * abnormal termination.
     *
     * <p> The virtual machine's shutdown sequence consists of two phases.  In
     * the first phase all registered {@link #addShutdownHook shutdown hooks},
     * if any, are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run
     * concurrently until they finish.  In the second phase all uninvoked
     * finalizers are run if {@link #runFinalizersOnExit finalization-on-exit}
     * has been enabled.  Once this is done the virtual machine {@link #halt
     * halts}.
     *
     * <p> If this method is invoked after the virtual machine has begun its
     * shutdown sequence then if shutdown hooks are being run this method will
     * block indefinitely.  If shutdown hooks have already been run and on-exit
     * finalization has been enabled then this method halts the virtual machine
     * with the given status code if the status is nonzero; otherwise, it
     * blocks indefinitely.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>{@link System#exit(int) System.exit}</tt> method is the
     * conventional and convenient means of invoking this method. <p>
     *
     * @param  status
     *         Termination status.  By convention, a nonzero status code
     *         indicates abnormal termination.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *         If a security manager is present and its <tt>{@link
     *         SecurityManager#checkExit checkExit}</tt> method does not permit
     *         exiting with the specified status
