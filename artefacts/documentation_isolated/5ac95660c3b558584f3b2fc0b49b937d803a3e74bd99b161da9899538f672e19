     * Returns the Java language modifiers for this class or interface, encoded
     * in an integer. The modifiers consist of the Java Virtual Machine's
     * constants for {@code public}, {@code protected},
     * {@code private}, {@code final}, {@code static},
     * {@code abstract} and {@code interface}; they should be decoded
     * using the methods of class {@code Modifier}.
     *
     * <p> If the underlying class is an array class, then its
     * {@code public}, {@code private} and {@code protected}
     * modifiers are the same as those of its component type.  If this
     * {@code Class} represents a primitive type or void, its
     * {@code public} modifier is always {@code true}, and its
     * {@code protected} and {@code private} modifiers are always
     * {@code false}. If this object represents an array class, a
     * primitive type or void, then its {@code final} modifier is always
     * {@code true} and its interface modifier is always
     * {@code false}. The values of its other modifiers are not determined
     * by this specification.
     *
     * <p> The modifier encodings are defined in <em>The Java Virtual Machine
     * Specification</em>, table 4.1.
