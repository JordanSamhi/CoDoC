     * Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
     * directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
     *
     * <p> If this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, then this
     * method returns {@code null}.  Otherwise an array of strings is
     * returned, one for each file or directory in the directory.  Names
     * denoting the directory itself and the directory's parent directory are
     * not included in the result.  Each string is a file name rather than a
     * complete path.
     *
     * <p> There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array
     * will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular,
     * guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order.
     *
     * <p> Note that the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines the {@link
     * java.nio.file.Files#newDirectoryStream(Path) newDirectoryStream} method to
     * open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
     * This may use less resources when working with very large directories, and
     * may be more responsive when working with remote directories.
     *
     * @return  An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
     *          directory denoted by this abstract pathname.  The array will be
     *          empty if the directory is empty.  Returns {@code null} if
     *          this abstract pathname does not denote a directory, or if an
     *          I/O error occurs.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method denies read access to
     *          the directory
