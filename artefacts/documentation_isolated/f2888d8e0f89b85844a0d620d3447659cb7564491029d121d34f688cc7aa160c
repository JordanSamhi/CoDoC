     * Writes this property list (key and element pairs) in this
     * {@code Properties} table to the output character stream in a
     * format suitable for using the {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)}
     * method.
     * <p>
     * Properties from the defaults table of this {@code Properties}
     * table (if any) are <i>not</i> written out by this method.
     * <p>
     * If the comments argument is not null, then an ASCII {@code #}
     * character, the comments string, and a line separator are first written
     * to the output stream. Thus, the {@code comments} can serve as an
     * identifying comment. Any one of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage
     * return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed
     * in comments is replaced by a line separator generated by the {@code Writer}
     * and if the next character in comments is not character {@code #} or
     * character {@code !} then an ASCII {@code #} is written out
     * after that line separator.
     * <p>
     * Next, a comment line is always written, consisting of an ASCII
     * {@code #} character, the current date and time (as if produced
     * by the {@code toString} method of {@code Date} for the
     * current time), and a line separator as generated by the {@code Writer}.
     * <p>
     * Then every entry in this {@code Properties} table is
     * written out, one per line. For each entry the key string is
     * written, then an ASCII {@code =}, then the associated
     * element string. For the key, all space characters are
     * written with a preceding {@code \} character.  For the
     * element, leading space characters, but not embedded or trailing
     * space characters, are written with a preceding {@code \}
     * character. The key and element characters {@code #},
     * {@code !}, {@code =}, and {@code :} are written
     * with a preceding backslash to ensure that they are properly loaded.
     * <p>
     * After the entries have been written, the output stream is flushed.
     * The output stream remains open after this method returns.
     * <p>
     *
     * @param   writer      an output character stream writer.
     * @param   comments   a description of the property list.
     * @exception  IOException if writing this property list to the specified
     *             output stream throws an <tt>IOException</tt>.
     * @exception  ClassCastException  if this {@code Properties} object
     *             contains any keys or values that are not {@code Strings}.
     * @exception  NullPointerException  if {@code writer} is null.
