     * Causes the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the
     * subprocess represented by this {@code Process} object has
     * terminated, or the specified waiting time elapses.
     *
     * <p>If the subprocess has already terminated then this method returns
     * immediately with the value {@code true}.  If the process has not
     * terminated and the timeout value is less than, or equal to, zero, then
     * this method returns immediately with the value {@code false}.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation of this methods polls the {@code exitValue}
     * to check if the process has terminated. Concrete implementations of this
     * class are strongly encouraged to override this method with a more
     * efficient implementation.
     *
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code timeout} argument
     * @return {@code true} if the subprocess has exited and {@code false} if
     *         the waiting time elapsed before the subprocess has exited.
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     *         while waiting.
     * @throws NullPointerException if unit is null
