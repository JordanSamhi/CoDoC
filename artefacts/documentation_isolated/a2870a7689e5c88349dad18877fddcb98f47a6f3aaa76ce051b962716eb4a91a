     * Determines if the specified character is a titlecase character.
     * <p>
     * A character is a titlecase character if its general
     * category type, provided by {@code Character.getType(ch)},
     * is {@code TITLECASE_LETTER}.
     * <p>
     * Some characters look like pairs of Latin letters. For example, there
     * is an uppercase letter that looks like "LJ" and has a corresponding
     * lowercase letter that looks like "lj". A third form, which looks like "Lj",
     * is the appropriate form to use when rendering a word in lowercase
     * with initial capitals, as for a book title.
     * <p>
     * These are some of the Unicode characters for which this method returns
     * {@code true}:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON}
     * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH SMALL LETTER J}
     * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH SMALL LETTER J}
     * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z}
     * </ul>
     * <p> Many other Unicode characters are titlecase too.
     *
