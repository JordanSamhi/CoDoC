     * Reads a signed 16-bit number from this file. The method reads two
     * bytes from this file, starting at the current file pointer.
     * If the two bytes read, in order, are
     * {@code b1} and {@code b2}, where each of the two values is
     * between {@code 0} and {@code 255}, inclusive, then the
     * result is equal to:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     (short)((b1 &lt;&lt; 8) | b2)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the two bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next two bytes of this file, interpreted as a signed
     *             16-bit number.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file reaches the end before reading
     *               two bytes.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
