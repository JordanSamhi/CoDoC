     * Reads an "unshared" object from the ObjectInputStream.  This method is
     * identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
     * readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
     * deserialized instance obtained via this call.  Specifically:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
     *       stream representation of an object which has been written
     *       previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
     *       thrown.
     *
     *   <li>If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
     *       to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
     *       by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.
     * </ul>
     * Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
     * associated with the returned object.  Note that this in itself does not
     * always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
     * the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
     * object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
     * object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
     * external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
     * and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
     * returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
     * array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
     * invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
     * even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.
     *
     * <p>ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
     * constructed in security contexts possessing the
     * "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
     * instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
     * SecurityException to be thrown.
