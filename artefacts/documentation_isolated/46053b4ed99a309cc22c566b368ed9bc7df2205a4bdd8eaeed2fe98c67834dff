     * Posts a synchronization barrier to the Looper's message queue.
     *
     * Message processing occurs as usual until the message queue encounters the
     * synchronization barrier that has been posted.  When the barrier is encountered,
     * later synchronous messages in the queue are stalled (prevented from being executed)
     * until the barrier is released by calling {@link #removeSyncBarrier} and specifying
     * the token that identifies the synchronization barrier.
     *
     * This method is used to immediately postpone execution of all subsequently posted
     * synchronous messages until a condition is met that releases the barrier.
     * Asynchronous messages (see {@link Message#isAsynchronous} are exempt from the barrier
     * and continue to be processed as usual.
     *
     * This call must be always matched by a call to {@link #removeSyncBarrier} with
     * the same token to ensure that the message queue resumes normal operation.
     * Otherwise the application will probably hang!
     *
     * @return A token that uniquely identifies the barrier.  This token must be
     * passed to {@link #removeSyncBarrier} to release the barrier.
