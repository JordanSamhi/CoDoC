     *
     * <p> Unless the current thread is interrupting itself, which is
     * always permitted, the {@link #checkAccess() checkAccess} method
     * of this thread is invoked, which may cause a {@link
     * SecurityException} to be thrown.
     *
     * <p> If this thread is blocked in an invocation of the {@link
     * Object#wait() wait()}, {@link Object#wait(long) wait(long)}, or {@link
     * Object#wait(long, int) wait(long, int)} methods of the {@link Object}
     * class, or of the {@link #join()}, {@link #join(long)}, {@link
     * #join(long, int)}, {@link #sleep(long)}, or {@link #sleep(long, int)},
     * methods of this class, then its interrupt status will be cleared and it
     * will receive an {@link InterruptedException}.
     *
     * <p> If this thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon an {@link
     * java.nio.channels.InterruptibleChannel InterruptibleChannel}
     * then the channel will be closed, the thread's interrupt
     * status will be set, and the thread will receive a {@link
     * java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException}.
     *
     * <p> If this thread is blocked in a {@link java.nio.channels.Selector}
     * then the thread's interrupt status will be set and it will return
     * immediately from the selection operation, possibly with a non-zero
     * value, just as if the selector's {@link
     * java.nio.channels.Selector#wakeup wakeup} method were invoked.
     *
     * <p> If none of the previous conditions hold then this thread's interrupt
     * status will be set. </p>
     *
     * <p> Interrupting a thread that is not alive need not have any effect.
