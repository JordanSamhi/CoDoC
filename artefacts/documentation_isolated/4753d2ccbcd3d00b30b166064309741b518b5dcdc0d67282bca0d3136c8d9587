     * Constructs and returns a PropertyValuesHolder object with the specified property name and set
     * of values. These values can be of any type, but the type should be consistent so that
     * an appropriate {@link android.animation.TypeEvaluator} can be found that matches
     * the common type.
     * <p>If there is only one value, it is assumed to be the end value of an animation,
     * and an initial value will be derived, if possible, by calling a getter function
     * on the object. Also, if any value is null, the value will be filled in when the animation
     * starts in the same way. This mechanism of automatically getting null values only works
     * if the PropertyValuesHolder object is used in conjunction
     * {@link ObjectAnimator}, and with a getter function
     * derived automatically from <code>propertyName</code>, since otherwise PropertyValuesHolder has
     * no way of determining what the value should be.
     * @param propertyName The name of the property associated with this set of values. This
     * can be the actual property name to be used when using a ObjectAnimator object, or
     * just a name used to get animated values, such as if this object is used with an
     * ValueAnimator object.
     * @param values The set of values to animate between.
