     * Reads the next byte of data from this input stream. The value
     * byte is returned as an <code>int</code> in the range
     * <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. If no byte is available
     * because the end of the stream has been reached, the value
     * <code>-1</code> is returned. This method blocks until input data
     * is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception
     * is thrown.
     *
     * <p> This method returns the most recently pushed-back byte, if there is
     * one, and otherwise calls the <code>read</code> method of its underlying
     * input stream and returns whatever value that method returns.
     *
     * @return     the next byte of data, or <code>-1</code> if the end of the
     *             stream has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException  if this input stream has been closed by
     *             invoking its {@link #close()} method,
     *             or an I/O error occurs.
