     * Opens or creates a file for reading and/or writing, returning an
     * asynchronous file channel to access the file.
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same way as the
     * invocation
     * <pre>
     *     ch.{@link #open(Path,Set,ExecutorService,FileAttribute[])
     *       open}(file, opts, null, new FileAttribute&lt;?&gt;[0]);
     * </pre>
     * where {@code opts} is a {@code Set} containing the options specified to
     * this method.
     *
     * <p> The resulting channel is associated with default thread pool to which
     * tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion
     * handlers that consume the result of asynchronous operations performed on
     * the resulting channel.
     *
     * @param   file
     *          The path of the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          Options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  A new asynchronous file channel
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          If the set contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          If the {@code file} is associated with a provider that does not
     *          support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
     *          specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager is installed and it denies an
     *          unspecified permission required by the implementation.
     *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          read access if the file is opened for reading. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          write access if the file is opened for writing
