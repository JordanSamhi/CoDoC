     * Converts the specified character (Unicode code point) to its
     * UTF-16 representation stored in a {@code char} array. If
     * the specified code point is a BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane or
     * Plane 0) value, the resulting {@code char} array has
     * the same value as {@code codePoint}. If the specified code
     * point is a supplementary code point, the resulting
     * {@code char} array has the corresponding surrogate pair.
     *
     * @param  codePoint a Unicode code point
     * @return a {@code char} array having
     *         {@code codePoint}'s UTF-16 representation.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the specified
     * {@code codePoint} is not a valid Unicode code point.
