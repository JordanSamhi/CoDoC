     * <p> The iterator returned by this method first yields all of the
     * elements of the provider cache, in instantiation order.  It then lazily
     * loads and instantiates any remaining providers, adding each one to the
     * cache in turn.
     *
     * <p> To achieve laziness the actual work of parsing the available
     * provider-configuration files and instantiating providers must be done by
     * the iterator itself.  Its {@link java.util.Iterator#hasNext hasNext} and
     * {@link java.util.Iterator#next next} methods can therefore throw a
     * {@link ServiceConfigurationError} if a provider-configuration file
     * violates the specified format, or if it names a provider class that
     * cannot be found and instantiated, or if the result of instantiating the
     * class is not assignable to the service type, or if any other kind of
     * exception or error is thrown as the next provider is located and
     * instantiated.  To write robust code it is only necessary to catch {@link
     * ServiceConfigurationError} when using a service iterator.
     *
     * <p> If such an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the
     * iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next
     * available provider, but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed.

     * Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme.  The rationale for
     * this behavior is that a malformed provider-configuration file, like a
     * malformed class file, indicates a serious problem with the way the Java
     * virtual machine is configured or is being used.  As such it is
     * preferable to throw an error rather than try to recover or, even worse,
     * fail silently.</blockquote>

     * <p> The iterator returned by this method does not support removal.
     * Invoking its {@link java.util.Iterator#remove() remove} method will
     * cause an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
     *
     * @implNote When adding providers to the cache, the {@link #iterator

     * java.lang.ClassLoader#getResources(java.lang.String)
     * ClassLoader.getResources(String)} method finds the service configuration
     * files.
