     * Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The
     * {@code X509Certificate} must contain all or at least one
     * of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
     * the matchAllNames flag (see {@link #setMatchAllSubjectAltNames
     * setMatchAllSubjectAltNames}).
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
     * alternative names.
     * The specified name is added to any previous value for the
     * subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
     * duplicate, it may be ignored.
     * <p>
     * The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
     * the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
     * defined in RFC 3280 and X.509. The encoded byte array should only contain
     * the encoded value of the name, and should not include the tag associated
     * with the name in the GeneralName structure. The ASN.1 definition of this
     * structure appears below.
     * <pre>{@code
