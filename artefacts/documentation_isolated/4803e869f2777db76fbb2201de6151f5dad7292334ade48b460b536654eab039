     * Randomly permutes the specified list using a default source of
     * randomness.  All permutations occur with approximately equal
     * likelihood.
     *
     * <p>The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description because
     * default source of randomness is only approximately an unbiased source
     * of independently chosen bits. If it were a perfect source of randomly
     * chosen bits, then the algorithm would choose permutations with perfect
     * uniformity.
     *
     * <p>This implementation traverses the list backwards, from the last
     * element up to the second, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element
     * into the "current position".  Elements are randomly selected from the
     * portion of the list that runs from the first element to the current
     * position, inclusive.
     *
     * <p>This method runs in linear time.  If the specified list does not
     * implement the {@link RandomAccess} interface and is large, this
     * implementation dumps the specified list into an array before shuffling
     * it, and dumps the shuffled array back into the list.  This avoids the
     * quadratic behavior that would result from shuffling a "sequential
     * access" list in place.
     *
     * @param  list the list to be shuffled.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the specified list or
     *         its list-iterator does not support the <tt>set</tt> operation.
