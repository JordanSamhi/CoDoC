     * Returns a {@code Short} object holding the
     * value given by the specified {@code String}. The argument
     * is interpreted as representing a signed decimal
     * {@code short}, exactly as if the argument were given to
     * the {@link #parseShort(java.lang.String)} method. The result is
     * a {@code Short} object that represents the
     * {@code short} value specified by the string.
     *
     * <p>In other words, this method returns a {@code Short} object
     * equal to the value of:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code new Short(Short.parseShort(s))}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @param s the string to be parsed
     * @return  a {@code Short} object holding the value
     *          represented by the string argument
     * @throws  NumberFormatException If the {@code String} does
     *          not contain a parsable {@code short}.
