     * Opens a directory, returning a {@link DirectoryStream} to iterate over
     * the entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
     * stream's {@link DirectoryStream#iterator iterator} are of type {@code
     * Path}, each one representing an entry in the directory. The {@code Path}
     * objects are obtained as if by {@link Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the
     * name of the directory entry against {@code dir}. The entries returned by
     * the iterator are filtered by matching the {@code String} representation
     * of their file names against the given <em>globbing</em> pattern.
     *
     * <p> For example, suppose we want to iterate over the files ending with
     * ".java" in a directory:
     * <pre>
     *     Path dir = ...
     *     try (DirectoryStream&lt;Path&gt; stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.java")) {
     *         :
     *     }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p> The globbing pattern is specified by the {@link
     * FileSystem#getPathMatcher getPathMatcher} method.
     *
     * <p> When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
     * stream's {@code close} method should be invoked after iteration is
     * completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.
     *
     * <p> When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
     * directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
     * stream is a {@link SecureDirectoryStream}.
     *
     * @param   dir
     *          the path to the directory
     * @param   glob
     *          the glob pattern
     *
     * @return  a new and open {@code DirectoryStream} object
     *
     * @throws  java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException
     *          if the pattern is invalid
     * @throws  NotDirectoryException
     *          if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
     *          a directory <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the directory.
