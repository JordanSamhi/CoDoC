     * Returns a copy of this date with the specified amount added.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDate}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
     * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, adding the amount can cause the resulting date to become invalid.
     * For example, adding one month to 31st January would result in 31st February.
     * In cases like this, the unit is responsible for resolving the date.
     * Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
     * day of February in this example.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented here.
     * The supported fields behave as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code DAYS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of days added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusDays(long)}.
     * <li>{@code WEEKS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of weeks added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusWeeks(long)} and uses a 7 day week.
     * <li>{@code MONTHS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of months added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusMonths(long)}.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code YEARS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of years added.
     *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusYears(long)}.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code DECADES} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of decades added.
     *  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 10.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code CENTURIES} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of centuries added.
     *  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 100.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code MILLENNIA} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of millennia added.
     *  This is equivalent to calling {@link #plusYears(long)} with the amount
     *  multiplied by 1,000.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code ERAS} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of eras added.
     *  Only two eras are supported so the amount must be one, zero or minus one.
     *  If the amount is non-zero then the year is changed such that the year-of-era
     *  is unchanged.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged unless it would be invalid for the new
     *  month and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum
     *  valid value for the new month and year.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * All other {@code ChronoUnit} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
     * whether and how to perform the addition.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param amountToAdd  the amount of the unit to add to the result, may be negative
     * @param unit  the unit of the amount to add, not null
     * @return a {@code LocalDate} based on this date with the specified amount added, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
