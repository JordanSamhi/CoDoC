     * Returns a concurrent {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a
     * {@code ConcurrentMap} whose keys and values are the result of applying
     * the provided mapping functions to the input elements.
     *
     * <p>If the mapped keys contains duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}),
     * the value mapping function is applied to each equal element, and the
     * results are merged using the provided merging function.  The
     * {@code ConcurrentMap} is created by a provided supplier function.
     *
     * <p>This is a {@link Collector.Characteristics#CONCURRENT concurrent} and
     * {@link Collector.Characteristics#UNORDERED unordered} Collector.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param <K> the output type of the key mapping function
     * @param <U> the output type of the value mapping function
     * @param <M> the type of the resulting {@code ConcurrentMap}
     * @param keyMapper a mapping function to produce keys
     * @param valueMapper a mapping function to produce values
     * @param mergeFunction a merge function, used to resolve collisions between
     *                      values associated with the same key, as supplied
     *                      to {@link Map#merge(Object, Object, BiFunction)}
     * @param mapSupplier a function which returns a new, empty {@code Map} into
     *                    which the results will be inserted
     * @return a concurrent, unordered {@code Collector} which collects elements into a
     * {@code ConcurrentMap} whose keys are the result of applying a key mapping
     * function to the input elements, and whose values are the result of
     * applying a value mapping function to all input elements equal to the key
     * and combining them using the merge function
