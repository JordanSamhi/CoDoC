     * Sets the PolicyQualifiersRejected flag. If this flag is true,
     * certificates that include policy qualifiers in a certificate
     * policies extension that is marked critical are rejected.
     * If the flag is false, certificates are not rejected on this basis.
     *
     * <p> When a {@code PKIXParameters} object is created, this flag is
     * set to true. This setting reflects the most common (and simplest)
     * strategy for processing policy qualifiers. Applications that want to use
     * a more sophisticated policy must set this flag to false.
     * <p>
     * Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
     * that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
     * marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise the
     * certification path must be rejected. If the policyQualifiersRejected flag
     * is set to false, it is up to the application to validate all policy
     * qualifiers in this manner in order to be PKIX compliant.
