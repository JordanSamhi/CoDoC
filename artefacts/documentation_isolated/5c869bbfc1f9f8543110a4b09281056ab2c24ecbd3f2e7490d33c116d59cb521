     * Returns a {@code Byte} instance representing the specified
     * {@code byte} value.
     * If a new {@code Byte} instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Byte(byte)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance since
     * all byte values are cached.
     *
     * @param  b a byte value.
     * @return a {@code Byte} instance representing {@code b}.
