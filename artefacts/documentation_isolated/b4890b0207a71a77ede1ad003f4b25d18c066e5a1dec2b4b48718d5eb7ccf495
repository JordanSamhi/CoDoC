     * Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffers.
     *
     * <p> Bytes are read starting at this channel's current file position, and
     * then the file position is updated with the number of bytes actually
     * read.  Otherwise this method behaves exactly as specified in the {@link
     * ScatteringByteChannel} interface.  </p>
