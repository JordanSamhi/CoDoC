     * Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will
     * fail if the task has already completed or could not be
     * cancelled for some other reason. If successful, and this task
     * has not started when {@code cancel} is called, execution of
     * this task is suppressed. After this method returns
     * successfully, unless there is an intervening call to {@link
     * #reinitialize}, subsequent calls to {@link #isCancelled},
     * {@link #isDone}, and {@code cancel} will return {@code true}
     * and calls to {@link #join} and related methods will result in
     * {@code CancellationException}.
     *
     * <p>This method may be overridden in subclasses, but if so, must
     * still ensure that these properties hold. In particular, the
     * {@code cancel} method itself must not throw exceptions.
     *
     * <p>This method is designed to be invoked by <em>other</em>
     * tasks. To terminate the current task, you can just return or
     * throw an unchecked exception from its computation method, or
     * invoke {@link #completeExceptionally(Throwable)}.
     *
     * @param mayInterruptIfRunning this value has no effect in the
     * default implementation because interrupts are not used to
     * control cancellation.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if this task is now cancelled
