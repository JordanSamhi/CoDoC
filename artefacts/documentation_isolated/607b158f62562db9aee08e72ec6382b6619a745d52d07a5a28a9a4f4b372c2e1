     * Returns a SecureRandom object that implements the specified
     * Random Number Generator (RNG) algorithm.
     *
     * <p> A new SecureRandom object encapsulating the
     * SecureRandomSpi implementation from the specified Provider
     * object is returned.  Note that the specified Provider object
     * does not have to be registered in the provider list.
     *
     * <p> The returned SecureRandom object has not been seeded.  To seed the
     * returned object, call the {@code setSeed} method.
     * If {@code setSeed} is not called, the first call to
     * {@code nextBytes} will force the SecureRandom object to seed itself.
     * This self-seeding will not occur if {@code setSeed} was
     * previously called.
     *
     * @param algorithm the name of the RNG algorithm.
     * See the SecureRandom section in the <a href=
     * "{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#SecureRandom">
     * Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation</a>
     * for information about standard RNG algorithm names.
     *
     * @param provider the provider.
     *
     * @return the new SecureRandom object.
     *
     * @exception NoSuchAlgorithmException if a SecureRandomSpi
     *          implementation for the specified algorithm is not available
     *          from the specified Provider object.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the specified provider is null.
