     * Enables/Disables tracing of method calls.
     * If the <code>boolean</code> argument is <code>true</code>, this
     * method suggests that the Java virtual machine emit debugging
     * information for each method in the virtual machine as it is
     * called. The format of this information, and the file or other output
     * stream to which it is emitted, depends on the host environment. The
     * virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support
     * this feature.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method with argument false suggests that the
     * virtual machine cease emitting per-call debugging information.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method on Android Lollipop or later (API level >= 21)
     * with {@code true} argument will cause it to throw an
     * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @param   on   <code>true</code> to enable instruction tracing;
     *               <code>false</code> to disable this feature.
