     * Adds a name to the pathToNames criterion. The {@code X509Certificate}
     * must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
     * path to the specified name.
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of names which
     * the {@code X509Certificates}'s name constraints must permit.
     * The specified name is added to any previous value for the
     * pathToNames criterion. If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
     * <p>
     * The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
     * the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
     * defined in RFC 3280 and X.509. The ASN.1 definition of this structure
     * appears in the documentation for
     * {@link #addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)
     * addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
     *
     * @param type the name type (0-8, as specified in
     *             RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.7)
     * @param name a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form
     * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
