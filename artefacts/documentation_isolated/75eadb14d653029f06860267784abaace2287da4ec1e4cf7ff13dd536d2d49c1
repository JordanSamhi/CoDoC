     * Returns a {@link Condition} instance for use with this
     * {@link Lock} instance.
     *
     * <p>The returned {@link Condition} instance supports the same
     * usages as do the {@link Object} monitor methods ({@link
     * Object#wait() wait}, {@link Object#notify notify}, and {@link
     * Object#notifyAll notifyAll}) when used with the built-in
     * monitor lock.
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If this lock is not held when any of the {@link Condition}
     * {@linkplain Condition#await() waiting} or {@linkplain
     * Condition#signal signalling} methods are called, then an {@link
     * IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown.
     *
     * <li>When the condition {@linkplain Condition#await() waiting}
     * methods are called the lock is released and, before they
     * return, the lock is reacquired and the lock hold count restored
     * to what it was when the method was called.
     *
     * <li>If a thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}
     * while waiting then the wait will terminate, an {@link
     * InterruptedException} will be thrown, and the thread's
     * interrupted status will be cleared.
     *
     * <li>Waiting threads are signalled in FIFO order.
     *
     * <li>The ordering of lock reacquisition for threads returning
     * from waiting methods is the same as for threads initially
     * acquiring the lock, which is in the default case not specified,
     * but for <em>fair</em> locks favors those threads that have been
     * waiting the longest.
     *
     * </ul>
