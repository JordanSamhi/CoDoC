     * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the hour-of-day altered.
     * <p>
     * This operates on the local time-line,
     * {@linkplain LocalDateTime#withHour(int) changing the time} of the local date-time.
     * This is then converted back to a {@code ZonedDateTime}, using the zone ID
     * to obtain the offset.
     * <p>
     * When converting back to {@code ZonedDateTime}, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
     * then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
     * If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param hour  the hour-of-day to set in the result, from 0 to 23
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested hour, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the hour value is invalid
