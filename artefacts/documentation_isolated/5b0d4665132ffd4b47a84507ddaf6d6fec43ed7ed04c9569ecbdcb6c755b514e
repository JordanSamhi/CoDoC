         * Produces a method handle giving read access to a reflected field.
         * The type of the method handle will have a return type of the field's
         * value type.
         * If the field is static, the method handle will take no arguments.
         * Otherwise, its single argument will be the instance containing
         * the field.
         * If the field's {@code accessible} flag is not set,
         * access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
         * <p>
         * If the field is static, and
         * if the returned method handle is invoked, the field's class will
         * be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.
         * @param f the reflected field
         * @return a method handle which can load values from the reflected field
         * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails
         * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null
