     * <p>
     * This queries this date-time for the value of the specified field.
     * If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
     * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the query is implemented here.
     * The {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will return valid
     * values based on this date-time.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
     * and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

     * @param field  the field to get, not null

     * @throws DateTimeException if a value for the field cannot be obtained

     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
