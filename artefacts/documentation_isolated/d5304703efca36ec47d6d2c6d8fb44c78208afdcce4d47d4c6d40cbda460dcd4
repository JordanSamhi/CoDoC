     * Returns the "first day of year" adjuster, which returns a new date set to
     * the first day of the current year.
     * <p>
     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 will return 2011-01-01.<br>
     * The input 2011-02-15 will return 2011-01-01.<br>
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It is equivalent to:
     * <pre>
     *  temporal.with(DAY_OF_YEAR, 1);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return the first day-of-year adjuster, not null
