     * Runs the given possibly blocking task.  When {@linkplain
     * ForkJoinTask#inForkJoinPool() running in a ForkJoinPool}, this
     * method possibly arranges for a spare thread to be activated if
     * necessary to ensure sufficient parallelism while the current
     * thread is blocked in {@link ManagedBlocker#block blocker.block()}.
     *
     * <p>This method repeatedly calls {@code blocker.isReleasable()} and
     * {@code blocker.block()} until either method returns {@code true}.
     * Every call to {@code blocker.block()} is preceded by a call to
     * {@code blocker.isReleasable()} that returned {@code false}.
     *
     * <p>If not running in a ForkJoinPool, this method is
     * behaviorally equivalent to
     * <pre> {@code
     * while (!blocker.isReleasable())
     *   if (blocker.block())
     *     break;}</pre>
     *
     * If running in a ForkJoinPool, the pool may first be expanded to
     * ensure sufficient parallelism available during the call to
     * {@code blocker.block()}.
     *
     * @param blocker the blocker task
     * @throws InterruptedException if {@code blocker.block()} did so
