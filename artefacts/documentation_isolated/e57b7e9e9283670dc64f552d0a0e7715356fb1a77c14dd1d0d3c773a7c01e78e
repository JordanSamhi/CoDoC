     * Returns a {@code Collection} of {@code Certificate}s that
     * match the specified selector. If no {@code Certificate}s
     * match the selector, an empty {@code Collection} will be returned.
     * <p>
     * For some {@code CertStore} types, the resulting
     * {@code Collection} may not contain <b>all</b> of the
     * {@code Certificate}s that match the selector. For instance,
     * an LDAP {@code CertStore} may not search all entries in the
     * directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
     * contain the {@code Certificate}s it is looking for.
     * <p>
     * Some {@code CertStore} implementations (especially LDAP
     * {@code CertStore}s) may throw a {@code CertStoreException}
     * unless a non-null {@code CertSelector} is provided that
     * includes specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates.
     * Issuer and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.
     *
     * @param selector A {@code CertSelector} used to select which
     *  {@code Certificate}s should be returned. Specify {@code null}
     *  to return all {@code Certificate}s (if supported).
     * @return A {@code Collection} of {@code Certificate}s that
     *         match the specified selector (never {@code null})
     * @throws CertStoreException if an exception occurs
