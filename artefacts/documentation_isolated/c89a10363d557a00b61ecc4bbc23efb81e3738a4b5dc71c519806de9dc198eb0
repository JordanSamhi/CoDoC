     * Returns a copy of this date with the specified field set to a new value.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDate}, based on this one, with the value
     * for the specified field changed.
     * This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
     * If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
     * some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date to become invalid,
     * such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
     * In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
     * the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
     * The supported fields behave as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code DAY_OF_WEEK} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified day-of-week.
     *  The date is adjusted up to 6 days forward or backward within the boundary
     *  of a Monday to Sunday week.
     * <li>{@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-day-of-week.
     *  The date is adjusted to the specified month-based aligned-day-of-week.
     *  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts
     *  on the first day of that month.
     *  This may cause the date to be moved up to 6 days into the following month.
     * <li>{@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-day-of-week.
     *  The date is adjusted to the specified year-based aligned-day-of-week.
     *  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
     *  on the first day of that year.
     *  This may cause the date to be moved up to 6 days into the following year.
     * <li>{@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified day-of-month.
     *  The month and year will be unchanged. If the day-of-month is invalid for the
     *  year and month, then a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
     * <li>{@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified day-of-year.
     *  The year will be unchanged. If the day-of-year is invalid for the
     *  year, then a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
     * <li>{@code EPOCH_DAY} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified epoch-day.
     *  This completely replaces the date and is equivalent to {@link #ofEpochDay(long)}.
     * <li>{@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-month.
     *  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given month starts
     *  on the first day of that month.
     *  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
     *  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
     *  This may cause the date to be moved into the following month.
     * <li>{@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified aligned-week-of-year.
     *  Aligned weeks are counted such that the first week of a given year starts
     *  on the first day of that year.
     *  This adjustment moves the date in whole week chunks to match the specified week.
     *  The result will have the same day-of-week as this date.
     *  This may cause the date to be moved into the following year.
     * <li>{@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified month-of-year.
     *  The year will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
     *  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
     *  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified proleptic-month.
     *  The day-of-month will be unchanged, unless it would be invalid for the new month
     *  and year. In that case, the day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value
     *  for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified year-of-era.
     *  The era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
     *  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
     *  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified year.
     *  The month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
     *  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
     *  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
     * <li>{@code ERA} -
     *  Returns a {@code LocalDate} with the specified era.
     *  The year-of-era and month will be unchanged. The day-of-month will also be unchanged,
     *  unless it would be invalid for the new month and year. In that case, the
     *  day-of-month is adjusted to the maximum valid value for the new month and year.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
     * then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the field determines
     * whether and how to adjust the instant.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param field  the field to set in the result, not null
     * @param newValue  the new value of the field in the result
     * @return a {@code LocalDate} based on {@code this} with the specified field set, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the field cannot be set
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
