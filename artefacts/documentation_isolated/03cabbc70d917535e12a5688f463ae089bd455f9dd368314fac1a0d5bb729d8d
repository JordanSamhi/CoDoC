     * Returns the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, which adjusts the date to the
     * first occurrence of the specified day-of-week before the date being adjusted
     * unless it is already on that day in which case the same object is returned.
     * <p>
     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (MONDAY) will return 2011-01-10 (five days earlier).<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (WEDNESDAY) will return 2011-01-12 (three days earlier).<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (SATURDAY) will return 2011-01-15 (same as input).
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} field and the {@code DAYS} unit,
     * and assumes a seven day week.
     *
     * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week to check for or move the date to, not null
     * @return the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, not null
