     * Creates a new directory in the specified directory, using the given
     * prefix to generate its name.  The resulting {@code Path} is associated
     * with the same {@code FileSystem} as the given directory.
     *
     * <p> The details as to how the name of the directory is constructed is
     * implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
     * the {@code prefix} is used to construct candidate names.
     *
     * <p> As with the {@code createTempFile} methods, this method is only
     * part of a temporary-file facility. A {@link Runtime#addShutdownHook
     * shutdown-hook}, or the {@link java.io.File#deleteOnExit} mechanism may be
     * used to delete the directory automatically.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is optional {@link FileAttribute
     * file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
     * attribute is identified by its {@link FileAttribute#name name}. If more
     * than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
     * the last occurrence is ignored.
     *
     * @param   dir
     *          the path to directory in which to create the directory
     * @param   prefix
     *          the prefix string to be used in generating the directory's name;
     *          may be {@code null}
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the directory
     *
     * @return  the path to the newly created directory that did not exist before
     *          this method was invoked
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the prefix cannot be used to generate a candidate directory name
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the directory
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or {@code dir} does not exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access when creating the
     *          directory.
