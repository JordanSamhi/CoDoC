     * Searches a range of
     * the specified array of floats for the specified value using
     * the binary search algorithm.
     * The range must be sorted
     * (as by the {@link #sort(float[], int, int)} method)
     * prior to making this call. If
     * it is not sorted, the results are undefined. If the range contains
     * multiple elements with the specified value, there is no guarantee which
     * one will be found. This method considers all NaN values to be
     * equivalent and equal.
     *
     * @param a the array to be searched
     * @param fromIndex the index of the first element (inclusive) to be
     *          searched
     * @param toIndex the index of the last element (exclusive) to be searched
     * @param key the value to be searched for
     * @return index of the search key, if it is contained in the array
     *         within the specified range;
     *         otherwise, <tt>(-(<i>insertion point</i>) - 1)</tt>. The
     *         <i>insertion point</i> is defined as the point at which the
     *         key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first
     *         element in the range greater than the key,
     *         or <tt>toIndex</tt> if all
     *         elements in the range are less than the specified key. Note
     *         that this guarantees that the return value will be &gt;= 0 if
     *         and only if the key is found.
