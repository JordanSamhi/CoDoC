     * Returns a copy of this {@code Instant} truncated to the specified unit.
     * <p>
     * Truncating the instant returns a copy of the original with fields
     * smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
     * The fields are calculated on the basis of using a UTC offset as seen
     * in {@code toString}.
     * For example, truncating with the {@link ChronoUnit#MINUTES MINUTES} unit will
     * round down to the nearest minute, setting the seconds and nanoseconds to zero.
     * <p>
     * The unit must have a {@linkplain TemporalUnit#getDuration() duration}
     * that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
     * This includes all supplied time units on {@link ChronoUnit} and
     * {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS}. Other units throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
