     * Given a URL connect stream positioned at the beginning of the
     * representation of an object, this method reads that stream and
     * creates an object that matches one of the types specified.
     *
     * The default implementation of this method should call getContent()
     * and screen the return type for a match of the suggested types.
     *
     * @param      urlc   a URL connection.
     * @param      classes      an array of types requested
     * @return     the object read by the {@code ContentHandler} that is
     *                 the first match of the suggested types.
     *                 null if none of the requested  are supported.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs while reading the object.
     * @since 1.3
