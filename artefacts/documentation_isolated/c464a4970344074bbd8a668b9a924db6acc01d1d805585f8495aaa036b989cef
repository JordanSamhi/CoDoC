     * Tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal
     * file.  A file is <em>normal</em> if it is not a directory and, in
     * addition, satisfies other system-dependent criteria.  Any non-directory
     * file created by a Java application is guaranteed to be a normal file.
     *
     * <p> Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
     * that the file is not a normal file, or where several attributes of the
     * same file are required at the same time, then the {@link
     * java.nio.file.Files#readAttributes(Path,Class,LinkOption[])
     * Files.readAttributes} method may be used.
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the file denoted by this
     *          abstract pathname exists <em>and</em> is a normal file;
     *          <code>false</code> otherwise
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkRead(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies read access to the file
