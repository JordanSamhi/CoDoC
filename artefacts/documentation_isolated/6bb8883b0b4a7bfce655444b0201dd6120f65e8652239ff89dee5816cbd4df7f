     * {@linkplain #getSubjectAsBytes()} instead. This method should not be
     * relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
     * encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished
     * names.

     * Returns the subject criterion as a {@code String}. This
     * distinguished name must match the subject distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509Certificate}. If {@code null}, the subject criterion
     * is disabled and any subject distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a
     * distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

     * @return the required subject distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
