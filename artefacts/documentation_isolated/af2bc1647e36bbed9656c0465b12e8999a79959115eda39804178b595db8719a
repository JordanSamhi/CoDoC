 Tells which access-protection classes of members this lookup object can produce.
         *  The result is a bit-mask of the bits
         *  {@linkplain #PUBLIC PUBLIC (0x01)},
         *  {@linkplain #PRIVATE PRIVATE (0x02)},
         *  {@linkplain #PROTECTED PROTECTED (0x04)},
         *  and {@linkplain #PACKAGE PACKAGE (0x08)}.
         *  <p>
         *  A freshly-created lookup object
         *  on the {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#lookup() caller's class}
         *  has all possible bits set, since the caller class can access all its own members.
         *  A lookup object on a new lookup class
         *  {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in created from a previous lookup object}
         *  may have some mode bits set to zero.
         *  The purpose of this is to restrict access via the new lookup object,
         *  so that it can access only names which can be reached by the original
         *  lookup object, and also by the new lookup class.
         *  @return the lookup modes, which limit the kinds of access performed by this lookup object
