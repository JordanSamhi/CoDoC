         * Produces an early-bound method handle for a non-static method.
         * The receiver must have a supertype {@code defc} in which a method
         * of the given name and type is accessible to the lookup class.
         * The method and all its argument types must be accessible to the lookup object.
         * The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
         * without any insertion of an additional receiver parameter.
         * The given receiver will be bound into the method handle,
         * so that every call to the method handle will invoke the
         * requested method on the given receiver.
         * <p>
         * The returned method handle will have
         * {@linkplain MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector variable arity} if and only if
         * the method's variable arity modifier bit ({@code 0x0080}) is set
         * <em>and</em> the trailing array argument is not the only argument.
         * (If the trailing array argument is the only argument,
         * the given receiver value will be bound to it.)
         * <p>
         * This is equivalent to the following code:
         * <blockquote><pre>{@code
import static java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.*;
import static java.lang.invoke.MethodType.*;
...
MethodHandle mh0 = lookup().findVirtual(defc, name, type);
MethodHandle mh1 = mh0.bindTo(receiver);
MethodType mt1 = mh1.type();
if (mh0.isVarargsCollector())
  mh1 = mh1.asVarargsCollector(mt1.parameterType(mt1.parameterCount()-1));
return mh1;
         * }</pre></blockquote>
         * where {@code defc} is either {@code receiver.getClass()} or a super
         * type of that class, in which the requested method is accessible
         * to the lookup class.
         * (Note that {@code bindTo} does not preserve variable arity.)
         * @param receiver the object from which the method is accessed
         * @param name the name of the method
         * @param type the type of the method, with the receiver argument omitted
         * @return the desired method handle
         * @throws NoSuchMethodException if the method does not exist
         * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails
         *                                or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
         *                                is set and {@code asVarargsCollector} fails
         * @exception SecurityException if a security manager is present and it
         *                              <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">refuses access</a>
         * @throws NullPointerException if any argument is null
