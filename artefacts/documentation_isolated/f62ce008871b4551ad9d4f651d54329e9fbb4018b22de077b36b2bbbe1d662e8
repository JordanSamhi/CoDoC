     * <p>This method can be used to lookup CRL entries in indirect CRLs,
     * that means CRLs that contain entries from issuers other than the CRL
     * issuer. The default implementation will only return entries for
     * certificates issued by the CRL issuer. Subclasses that wish to
     * support indirect CRLs should override this method.
     *
     * @param certificate the certificate for which a CRL entry is to be looked
     *   up
     * @return the entry for the given certificate, or null if no such entry
     *   exists in this CRL.
     * @exception NullPointerException if certificate is null
