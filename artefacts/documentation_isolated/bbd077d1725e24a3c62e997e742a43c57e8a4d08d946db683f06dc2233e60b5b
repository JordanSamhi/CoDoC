     * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
     * long} values, each conforming to the given origin (inclusive) and bound
     * (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code long} value is generated as if it's the result
     * of calling the following method with the origin and bound:
     * <pre> {@code
     * long nextLong(long origin, long bound) {
     *   long r = nextLong();
     *   long n = bound - origin, m = n - 1;
     *   if ((n & m) == 0L)  // power of two
     *     r = (r & m) + origin;
     *   else if (n > 0L) {  // reject over-represented candidates
     *     for (long u = r >>> 1;            // ensure nonnegative
     *          u + m - (r = u % n) < 0L;    // rejection check
     *          u = nextLong() >>> 1) // retry
     *         ;
     *     r += origin;
     *   }
     *   else {              // range not representable as long
     *     while (r < origin || r >= bound)
     *       r = nextLong();
     *   }
     *   return r;
