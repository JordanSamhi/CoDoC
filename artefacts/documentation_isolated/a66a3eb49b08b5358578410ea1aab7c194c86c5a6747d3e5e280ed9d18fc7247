     * Obtains a period for this chronology based on years, months and days.
     * <p>
     * This returns a period tied to this chronology using the specified
     * years, months and days.  All supplied chronologies use periods
     * based on years, months and days, however the {@code ChronoPeriod} API
     * allows the period to be represented using other units.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation returns an implementation class suitable
     * for most calendar systems. It is based solely on the three units.
     * Normalization, addition and subtraction derive the number of months
     * in a year from the {@link #range(ChronoField)}. If the number of
     * months within a year is fixed, then the calculation approach for
     * addition, subtraction and normalization is slightly different.
     * <p>
     * If implementing an unusual calendar system that is not based on
     * years, months and days, or where you want direct control, then
     * the {@code ChronoPeriod} interface must be directly implemented.
     * <p>
     * The returned period is immutable and thread-safe.
