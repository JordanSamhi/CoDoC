         * Called by RecyclerView to display the data at the specified position. This method
         * should update the contents of the {@link ViewHolder#itemView} to reflect the item at
         * the given position.
         * <p>
         * Note that unlike {@link android.widget.ListView}, RecyclerView will not call this method
         * again if the position of the item changes in the data set unless the item itself is
         * invalidated or the new position cannot be determined. For this reason, you should only
         * use the <code>position</code> parameter while acquiring the related data item inside
         * this method and should not keep a copy of it. If you need the position of an item later
         * on (e.g. in a click listener), use {@link ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()} which will
         * have the updated adapter position.
         * <p>
         * Partial bind vs full bind:
         * <p>
         * The payloads parameter is a merge list from {@link #notifyItemChanged(int, Object)} or
         * {@link #notifyItemRangeChanged(int, int, Object)}.  If the payloads list is not empty,
         * the ViewHolder is currently bound to old data and Adapter may run an efficient partial
         * update using the payload info.  If the payload is empty,  Adapter must run a full bind.
         * Adapter should not assume that the payload passed in notify methods will be received by
         * onBindViewHolder().  For example when the view is not attached to the screen, the
         * payload in notifyItemChange() will be simply dropped.
         *
         * @param holder The ViewHolder which should be updated to represent the contents of the
         *               item at the given position in the data set.
         * @param position The position of the item within the adapter's data set.
         * @param payloads A non-null list of merged payloads. Can be empty list if requires full
         *                 update.
