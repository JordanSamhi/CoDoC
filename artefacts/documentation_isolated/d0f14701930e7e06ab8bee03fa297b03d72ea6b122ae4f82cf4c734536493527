     * Obtains an instance of {@code Duration} from a temporal amount.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a duration based on the specified amount.
     * A {@code TemporalAmount} represents an  amount of time, which may be
     * date-based or time-based, which this factory extracts to a duration.
     * <p>
     * The conversion loops around the set of units from the amount and uses
     * the {@linkplain TemporalUnit#getDuration() duration} of the unit to
     * calculate the total {@code Duration}.
     * Only a subset of units are accepted by this method. The unit must either
     * have an {@linkplain TemporalUnit#isDurationEstimated() exact duration}
     * or be {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS} which is treated as 24 hours.
     * If any other units are found then an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @param amount  the temporal amount to convert, not null
     * @return the equivalent duration, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code Duration}
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
