     * Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
     * {@code int} value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
     * There is one special case, if the dividend is the
     * {@linkplain Integer#MIN_VALUE Integer.MIN_VALUE} and the divisor is {@code -1},
     * then integer overflow occurs and
     * the result is equal to the {@code Integer.MIN_VALUE}.
     * <p>
     * See {@link Math#floorDiv(int, int) Math.floorDiv} for examples and
     * a comparison to the integer division {@code /} operator.
