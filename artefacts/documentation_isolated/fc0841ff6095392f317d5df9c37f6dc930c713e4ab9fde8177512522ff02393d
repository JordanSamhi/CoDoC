     * Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
     * held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
     * threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
     * operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
     * heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
     * usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
     * aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
     * tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
     * exceeded.
     *
     * @return the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative
