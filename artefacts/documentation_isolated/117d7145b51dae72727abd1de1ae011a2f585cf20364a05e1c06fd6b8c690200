         * <p>Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock
         * are held by another thread
         * and returns immediately, setting the write lock hold count to
         * one.
         *
         * <p>If the current thread already holds the write lock then the
         * hold count is incremented by one and the method returns
         * immediately.
         *
         * <p>If the lock is held by another thread then the current
         * thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and
         * lies dormant until the write lock has been acquired, at which
         * time the write lock hold count is set to one.
