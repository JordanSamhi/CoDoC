     * Calculates the amount of time until another time in terms of the specified unit.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code LocalTime}
     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified time.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
     * {@code LocalTime} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * For example, the amount in hours between two times can be calculated
     * using {@code startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)}.
     * <p>
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two times.
     * For example, the amount in hours between 11:30 and 13:29 will only
     * be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   amount = start.until(end, MINUTES);
     *   amount = MINUTES.between(start, end);
     * </pre>
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
     * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS} are supported.
     * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param endExclusive  the end time, exclusive, which is converted to a {@code LocalTime}, not null
     * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
     * @return the amount of time between this time and the end time
     * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
     *  temporal cannot be converted to a {@code LocalTime}
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
