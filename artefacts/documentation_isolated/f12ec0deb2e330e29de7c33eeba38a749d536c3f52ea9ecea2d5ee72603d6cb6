     * A convenience method to set the owner's execute permission for this
     * abstract pathname.
     *
     * <p>An invocation of this method of the form <tt>file.setExcutable(arg)</tt>
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     *
     * <pre>
     *     file.setExecutable(arg, true) </pre>
     *
     * @param   executable
     *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow execute
     *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow execute operations
     *
     * @return   <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded.  The
     *           operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
     *           change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.  If
     *           <code>executable</code> is <code>false</code> and the underlying
     *           file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
     *           operation will fail.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the file
