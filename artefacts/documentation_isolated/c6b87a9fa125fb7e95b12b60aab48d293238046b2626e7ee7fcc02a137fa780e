     * Checks if this time is equal to another time.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is based on the local-time and the offset.
     * To compare for the same instant on the time-line, use {@link #isEqual(OffsetTime)}.
     * <p>
     * Only objects of type {@code OffsetTime} are compared, other types return false.
     * To compare the underlying local time of two {@code TemporalAccessor} instances,
     * use {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_DAY} as a comparator.
     *
     * @param obj  the object to check, null returns false
     * @return true if this is equal to the other time
