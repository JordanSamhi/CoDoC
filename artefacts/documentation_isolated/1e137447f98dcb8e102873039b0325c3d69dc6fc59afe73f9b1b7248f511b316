     * Returns a copy of this formatter with a new set of resolver fields.
     * <p>
     * This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but with
     * the resolver fields set. By default, a formatter has no resolver fields.
     * <p>
     * Changing the resolver fields only has an effect during parsing.
     * Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
     * Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
     * Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
     * The resolver fields are used to filter the field-value pairs between phase 1 and 2.
     * <p>
     * This can be used to select between two or more ways that a date or time might
     * be resolved. For example, if the formatter consists of year, month, day-of-month
     * and day-of-year, then there are two ways to resolve a date.
     * Calling this method with the arguments {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} and
     * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_YEAR DAY_OF_YEAR} will ensure that the date is
     * resolved using the year and day-of-year, effectively meaning that the month
     * and day-of-month are ignored during the resolving phase.
     * <p>
     * In a similar manner, this method can be used to ignore secondary fields that
     * would otherwise be cross-checked. For example, if the formatter consists of year,
     * month, day-of-month and day-of-week, then there is only one way to resolve a
     * date, but the parsed value for day-of-week will be cross-checked against the
     * resolved date. Calling this method with the arguments {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR},
     * {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR MONTH_OF_YEAR} and
     * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH DAY_OF_MONTH} will ensure that the date is
     * resolved correctly, but without any cross-check for the day-of-week.
     * <p>
     * In implementation terms, this method behaves as follows. The result of the
     * parsing phase can be considered to be a map of field to value. The behavior
     * of this method is to cause that map to be filtered between phase 1 and 2,
     * removing all fields other than those specified as arguments to this method.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

     * @param resolverFields  the new set of resolver fields, null if no fields
     * @return a formatter based on this formatter with the requested resolver style, not null
