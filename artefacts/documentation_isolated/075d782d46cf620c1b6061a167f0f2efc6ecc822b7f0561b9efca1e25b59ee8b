     * Checks if the specified unit is supported.
     * <p>
     * This checks if the specified unit can be added to or subtracted from this date.
     * If false, then calling the {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)} and
     * {@link #minus(long, TemporalUnit) minus} methods will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * The set of supported units is defined by the chronology and normally includes
     * all {@code ChronoUnit} date units except {@code FOREVER}.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.
     *
     * @param unit  the unit to check, null returns false
     * @return true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not
