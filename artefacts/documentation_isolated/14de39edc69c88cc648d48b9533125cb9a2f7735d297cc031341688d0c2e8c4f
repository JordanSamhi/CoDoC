     * Returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the
     * directory denoted by this abstract pathname that satisfy the specified
     * filter.  The behavior of this method is the same as that of the
     * {@link #list()} method, except that the strings in the returned array
     * must satisfy the filter.  If the given {@code filter} is {@code null}
     * then all names are accepted.  Otherwise, a name satisfies the filter if
     * and only if the value {@code true} results when the {@link
     * FilenameFilter#accept FilenameFilter.accept(File,&nbsp;String)} method
     * of the filter is invoked on this abstract pathname and the name of a
     * file or directory in the directory that it denotes.
     *
     * @param  filter
     *         A filename filter
     *
     * @return  An array of strings naming the files and directories in the
     *          directory denoted by this abstract pathname that were accepted
     *          by the given {@code filter}.  The array will be empty if the
     *          directory is empty or if no names were accepted by the filter.
     *          Returns {@code null} if this abstract pathname does not denote
     *          a directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method denies read access to
     *          the directory
     *
