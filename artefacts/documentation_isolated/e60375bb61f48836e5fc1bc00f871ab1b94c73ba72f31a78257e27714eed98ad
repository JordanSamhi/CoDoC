     * Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by the specified
     * collection.  In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that
     * <strong>all</strong> access to the backing collection is accomplished
     * through the returned collection.<p>
     *
     * It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned
     * collection when traversing it via {@link Iterator}, {@link Spliterator}
     * or {@link Stream}:
     * <pre>
     *  Collection c = Collections.synchronizedCollection(myCollection);
     *     ...
     *  synchronized (c) {
     *      Iterator i = c.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block
     *      while (i.hasNext())
     *         foo(i.next());
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.
     *
     * <p>The returned collection does <i>not</i> pass the {@code hashCode}
     * and {@code equals} operations through to the backing collection, but
     * relies on {@code Object}'s equals and hashCode methods.  This is
     * necessary to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case
     * that the backing collection is a set or a list.<p>
     *
     * The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection
     * is serializable.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the collection
     * @param  c the collection to be "wrapped" in a synchronized collection.
     * @return a synchronized view of the specified collection.
