     * Reads a set of file attributes as a bulk operation.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attributes} parameter identifies the attributes to be read
     * and takes the form:
     * <blockquote>
     * [<i>view-name</i><b>:</b>]<i>attribute-list</i>
     * </blockquote>
     * where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
     * character {@code ':'} stands for itself.
     *
     * <p> <i>view-name</i> is the {@link FileAttributeView#name name} of a {@link
     * FileAttributeView} that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
     * specified then it defaults to {@code "basic"}, the name of the file
     * attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
     * many file systems.
     *
     * <p> The <i>attribute-list</i> component is a comma separated list of
     * zero or more names of attributes to read. If the list contains the value
     * {@code "*"} then all attributes are read. Attributes that are not supported
     * are ignored and will not be present in the returned map. It is
     * implementation specific if all attributes are read as an atomic operation
     * with respect to other file system operations.
     *
     * <p> The following examples demonstrate possible values for the {@code
     * attributes} parameter:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     * <table border="0" summary="Possible values">
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@code "*"} </td>
     *   <td> Read all {@link BasicFileAttributes basic-file-attributes}. </td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@code "size,lastModifiedTime,lastAccessTime"} </td>
     *   <td> Reads the file size, last modified time, and last access time
     *     attributes. </td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@code "posix:*"} </td>
     *   <td> Read all {@link PosixFileAttributes POSIX-file-attributes}. </td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@code "posix:permissions,owner,size"} </td>
     *   <td> Reads the POSX file permissions, owner, and file size. </td>
     * </tr>
     * </table>
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
     * symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
     * of the link is read. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS
     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   attributes
     *          the attributes to read
     * @param   options
     *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
     *
     * @return  a map of the attributes returned; The map's keys are the
     *          attribute names, its values are the attribute values
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the attribute view is not available
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if no attributes are specified or an unrecognized attributes is
     *          specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file. If this method is invoked
     *          to read security sensitive attributes then the security manager
     *          may be invoke to check for additional permissions.
