     * Gets the history of rules for the zone ID.
     * <p>
     * Time-zones are defined by governments and change frequently.
     * This method allows applications to find the history of changes to the
     * rules for a single zone ID. The map is keyed by a string, which is the
     * version string associated with the rules.
     * <p>
     * The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
     * The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
     * be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
     * The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
     * followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
     * they do not have to provide a history of rules.
     * Thus the map will always contain one element, and will only contain more
     * than one element if historical rule information is available.
     *
     * @param zoneId  the zone ID as defined by {@code ZoneId}, not null
     * @return a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
     *  from oldest to newest, not null
     * @throws ZoneRulesException if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID
