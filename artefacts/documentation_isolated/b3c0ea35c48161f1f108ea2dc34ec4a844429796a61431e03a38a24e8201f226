     * Updates the file owner.
     *
     * <p> The {@code path} parameter is associated with a file system that
     * supports {@link FileOwnerAttributeView}. This file attribute view provides
     * access to a file attribute that is the owner of the file.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
     * Suppose we want to make "joe" the owner of a file:
     * <pre>
     *     Path path = ...
     *     UserPrincipalLookupService lookupService =
     *         provider(path).getUserPrincipalLookupService();
     *     UserPrincipal joe = lookupService.lookupPrincipalByName("joe");
     *     Files.setOwner(path, joe);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          The path to the file
     * @param   owner
     *          The new file owner
     *
     * @return  The path
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the associated file system does not support the {@code
     *          FileOwnerAttributeView}
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, it denies {@link RuntimePermission}<tt>("accessUserInformation")</tt>
     *          or its {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method denies write access to the file.
