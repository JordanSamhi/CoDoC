     * Reads the next byte of data from this input stream. The byte is
     * returned as an <code>int</code> in the range <code>0</code> to
     * <code>255</code>. If no byte is available because the end of the
     * stream has been reached, the value <code>-1</code> is returned.
     * This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * This method
     * tries to read one character from the current substream. If it
     * reaches the end of the stream, it calls the <code>close</code>
     * method of the current substream and begins reading from the next
     * substream.
     *
     * @return     the next byte of data, or <code>-1</code> if the end of the
     *             stream is reached.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
