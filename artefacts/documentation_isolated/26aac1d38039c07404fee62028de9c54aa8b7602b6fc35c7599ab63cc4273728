     * Returns the size of a file (in bytes). The size may differ from the
     * actual size on the file system due to compression, support for sparse
     * files, or other reasons. The size of files that are not {@link
     * #isRegularFile regular} files is implementation specific and
     * therefore unspecified.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     *
     * @return  the file size, in bytes
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file.
