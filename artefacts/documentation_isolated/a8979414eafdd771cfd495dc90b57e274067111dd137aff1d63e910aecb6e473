     * Attempts to find the next occurrence of the specified pattern.
     *
     * <p>This method searches through the input up to the specified
     * search horizon, ignoring delimiters. If the pattern is found the
     * scanner advances past the input that matched and returns the string
     * that matched the pattern. If no such pattern is detected then the
     * null is returned and the scanner's position remains unchanged. This
     * method may block waiting for input that matches the pattern.
     *
     * <p>A scanner will never search more than <code>horizon</code> code
     * points beyond its current position. Note that a match may be clipped
     * by the horizon; that is, an arbitrary match result may have been
     * different if the horizon had been larger. The scanner treats the
     * horizon as a transparent, non-anchoring bound (see {@link
     * Matcher#useTransparentBounds} and {@link Matcher#useAnchoringBounds}).
     *
     * <p>If horizon is <code>0</code>, then the horizon is ignored and
     * this method continues to search through the input looking for the
     * specified pattern without bound. In this case it may buffer all of
     * the input searching for the pattern.
     *
     * <p>If horizon is negative, then an IllegalArgumentException is
     * thrown.
