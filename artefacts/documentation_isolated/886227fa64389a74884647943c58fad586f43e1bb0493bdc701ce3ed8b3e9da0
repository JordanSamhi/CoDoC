     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} from a year, month, day,
     * hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.
     * <p>
     * This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
     * specified fields as closely as possible.
     * Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
     * is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
     * <p>
     * The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
     * This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
     * date-time as defined by the {@link ZoneRules rules} of the zone ID.
     *<p>
     * In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
     * In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
     * This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".
     * <p>
     * In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
     * Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
     * For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
     * moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
     * <p>
     * This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
     * Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.
     * {@code LocalDateTime} has five additional convenience variants of the
     * equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
     * They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.
