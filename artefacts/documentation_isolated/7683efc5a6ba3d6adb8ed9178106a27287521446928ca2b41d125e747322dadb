     * Skips <code>n</code> bytes of input from this input stream. Fewer
     * bytes might be skipped if the end of the input stream is reached.
     * The actual number <code>k</code>
     * of bytes to be skipped is equal to the smaller
     * of <code>n</code> and  <code>count-pos</code>.
     * The value <code>k</code> is added into <code>pos</code>
     * and <code>k</code> is returned.
     *
     * @param   n   the number of bytes to be skipped.
     * @return  the actual number of bytes skipped.
