     * Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition
     * associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts
     * and interrupts may occur at any time, a {@code true} return
     * does not guarantee that a future {@code signal} will awaken
     * any threads.  This method is designed primarily for use in
     * monitoring of the system state.

     * @param condition the condition
     * @return {@code true} if there are any waiting threads
     * @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if exclusive synchronization
     *         is not held
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given condition is
     *         not associated with this synchronizer
     * @throws NullPointerException if the condition is null
