     * Obtains a {@code Duration} representing the duration between two temporal objects.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the duration between two temporal objects. If the objects
     * are of different types, then the duration is calculated based on the type
     * of the first object. For example, if the first argument is a {@code LocalTime}
     * then the second argument is converted to a {@code LocalTime}.
     * <p>
     * The specified temporal objects must support the {@link ChronoUnit#SECONDS SECONDS} unit.
     * For full accuracy, either the {@link ChronoUnit#NANOS NANOS} unit or the
     * {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_SECOND NANO_OF_SECOND} field should be supported.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method can be a negative period if the end is before the start.
     * To guarantee to obtain a positive duration call {@link #abs()} on the result.
     *
     * @param startInclusive  the start instant, inclusive, not null
     * @param endExclusive  the end instant, exclusive, not null
     * @return a {@code Duration}, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the seconds between the temporals cannot be obtained
     * @throws ArithmeticException if the calculation exceeds the capacity of {@code Duration}
