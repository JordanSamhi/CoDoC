     * Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
     * to be written out. The general contract of <code>flush</code> is
     * that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously
     * written have been buffered by the implementation of the output
     * stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their
     * intended destination.
     * <p>
     * If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by
     * the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
     * stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
     * passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
     * they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.
     * <p>
     * The <code>flush</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code> does nothing.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
