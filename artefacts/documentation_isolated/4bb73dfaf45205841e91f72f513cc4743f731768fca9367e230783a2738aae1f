     * above then the token is converted into a <tt>long</tt> value as if by
     * removing all locale specific prefixes, group separators, and locale
     * specific suffixes, then mapping non-ASCII digits into ASCII
     * digits via {@link Character#digit Character.digit}, prepending a
     * negative sign (-) if the locale specific negative prefixes and suffixes
     * were present, and passing the resulting string to
     * {@link Long#parseLong(String, int) Long.parseLong} with the
     * specified radix.

     * @param radix the radix used to interpret the token as an int value
