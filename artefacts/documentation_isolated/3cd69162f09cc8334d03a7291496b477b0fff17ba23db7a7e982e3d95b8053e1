         * Returns a new Builder object.
         *
         * <p>The first call to the {@link #getKeyStore} method on the returned
         * builder will create a KeyStore of type {@code type} and call
         * its {@link KeyStore#load load()} method.
         * The {@code inputStream} argument is constructed from
         * {@code file}.
         * If {@code protection} is a
         * {@code PasswordProtection}, the password is obtained by
         * calling the {@code getPassword} method.
         * Otherwise, if {@code protection} is a
         * {@code CallbackHandlerProtection}, the password is obtained
         * by invoking the CallbackHandler.
         *
         * <p>Subsequent calls to {@link #getKeyStore} return the same object
         * as the initial call. If the initial call to failed with a
         * KeyStoreException, subsequent calls also throw a
         * KeyStoreException.
         *
         * <p>The KeyStore is instantiated from {@code provider} if
         * non-null. Otherwise, all installed providers are searched.
         *
         * <p>Calls to {@link #getProtectionParameter getProtectionParameter()}
         * will return a {@link KeyStore.PasswordProtection PasswordProtection}
         * object encapsulating the password that was used to invoke the
         * {@code load} method.
         *
         * <p><em>Note</em> that the {@link #getKeyStore} method is executed
         * within the {@link AccessControlContext} of the code invoking this
         * method.
