     * Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code float}
     * value between {@code 0.0} and {@code 1.0} from this random
     * number generator's sequence.
     *
     * <p>The general contract of {@code nextFloat} is that one
     * {@code float} value, chosen (approximately) uniformly from the
     * range {@code 0.0f} (inclusive) to {@code 1.0f} (exclusive), is
     * pseudorandomly generated and returned. All 2<sup>24</sup> possible
     * {@code float} values of the form <i>m&nbsp;x&nbsp;</i>2<sup>-24</sup>,
     * where <i>m</i> is a positive integer less than 2<sup>24</sup>, are
     * produced with (approximately) equal probability.
     *
     * <p>The method {@code nextFloat} is implemented by class {@code Random}
     * as if by:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * public float nextFloat() {
     *   return next(24) / ((float)(1 << 24));
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description only
     * because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of
     * independently chosen bits. If it were a perfect source of randomly
     * chosen bits, then the algorithm shown would choose {@code float}
     * values from the stated range with perfect uniformity.<p>
     * [In early versions of Java, the result was incorrectly calculated as:
     *  <pre> {@code
     *   return next(30) / ((float)(1 << 30));}</pre>
     * This might seem to be equivalent, if not better, but in fact it
     * introduced a slight nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding
     * of floating-point numbers: it was slightly more likely that the
     * low-order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1.]
     *
     * @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code float}
     *         value between {@code 0.0} and {@code 1.0} from this
     *         random number generator's sequence
