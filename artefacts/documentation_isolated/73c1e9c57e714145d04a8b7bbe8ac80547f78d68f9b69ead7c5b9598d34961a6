     * Obtains a local date-time in this chronology from another temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a date-time in this chronology based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code ChronoLocalDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion extracts and combines the {@code ChronoLocalDate} and the
     * {@code LocalTime} from the temporal object.
     * Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
     * those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
     * The result uses this chronology.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code aChronology::localDateTime}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the local date-time in this chronology, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to create the date-time
     * @see ChronoLocalDateTime#from(TemporalAccessor)
