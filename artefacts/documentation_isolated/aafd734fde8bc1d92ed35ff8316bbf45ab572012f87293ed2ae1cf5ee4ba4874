     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified navigable map.
     * Any attempt to insert a mapping whose key or value have the wrong
     * type will result in an immediate {@link ClassCastException}.
     * Similarly, any attempt to modify the value currently associated with
     * a key will result in an immediate {@link ClassCastException},
     * whether the modification is attempted directly through the map
     * itself, or through a {@link Map.Entry} instance obtained from the
     * map's {@link Map#entrySet() entry set} view.
     *
     * <p>Assuming a map contains no incorrectly typed keys or values
     * prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and
     * that all subsequent access to the map takes place through the view
     * (or one of its collection views), it is <em>guaranteed</em> that the
     * map cannot contain an incorrectly typed key or value.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
     * checkedCollection} method.
     *
     * <p>The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is
     * serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned map permits insertion of null keys or values
     * whenever the backing map does.
