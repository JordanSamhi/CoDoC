     * Returns the {@code java.lang.Class} object for a proxy class
     * given a class loader and an array of interfaces.  The proxy class
     * will be defined by the specified class loader and will implement
     * all of the supplied interfaces.  If any of the given interfaces
     * is non-public, the proxy class will be non-public. If a proxy class
     * for the same permutation of interfaces has already been defined by the
     * class loader, then the existing proxy class will be returned; otherwise,
     * a proxy class for those interfaces will be generated dynamically
     * and defined by the class loader.
     *
     * <p>There are several restrictions on the parameters that may be
     * passed to {@code Proxy.getProxyClass}:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>All of the {@code Class} objects in the
     * {@code interfaces} array must represent interfaces, not
     * classes or primitive types.
     *
     * <li>No two elements in the {@code interfaces} array may
     * refer to identical {@code Class} objects.
     *
     * <li>All of the interface types must be visible by name through the
     * specified class loader.  In other words, for class loader
     * {@code cl} and every interface {@code i}, the following
     * expression must be true:
     * <pre>
     *     Class.forName(i.getName(), false, cl) == i
     * </pre>
     *
     * <li>All non-public interfaces must be in the same package;
     * otherwise, it would not be possible for the proxy class to
     * implement all of the interfaces, regardless of what package it is
     * defined in.
     *
     * <li>For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces
     * that have the same signature:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive
     * type or void, then all of the methods must have that same
     * return type.
     * <li>Otherwise, one of the methods must have a return type that
     * is assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the
     * methods.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <li>The resulting proxy class must not exceed any limits imposed
     * on classes by the virtual machine.  For example, the VM may limit
     * the number of interfaces that a class may implement to 65535; in
     * that case, the size of the {@code interfaces} array must not
     * exceed 65535.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If any of these restrictions are violated,
     * {@code Proxy.getProxyClass} will throw an
     * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.  If the {@code interfaces}
     * array argument or any of its elements are {@code null}, a
     * {@code NullPointerException} will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>Note that the order of the specified proxy interfaces is
     * significant: two requests for a proxy class with the same combination
     * of interfaces but in a different order will result in two distinct
     * proxy classes.
     *
     * @param   loader the class loader to define the proxy class
     * @param   interfaces the list of interfaces for the proxy class
     *          to implement
     * @return  a proxy class that is defined in the specified class loader
     *          and that implements the specified interfaces
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException if any of the restrictions on the
     *          parameters that may be passed to {@code getProxyClass}
     *          are violated
     * @throws  SecurityException if a security manager, <em>s</em>, is present
     *          and any of the following conditions is met:
     *          <ul>
     *             <li> the given {@code loader} is {@code null} and
     *             the caller's class loader is not {@code null} and the
     *             invocation of {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission
     *             s.checkPermission} with
     *             {@code RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")} permission
     *             denies access.</li>
     *             <li> for each proxy interface, {@code intf},
     *             the caller's class loader is not the same as or an
     *             ancestor of the class loader for {@code intf} and
     *             invocation of {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     *             s.checkPackageAccess()} denies access to {@code intf}.</li>
     *          </ul>
     * @throws  NullPointerException if the {@code interfaces} array
     *          argument or any of its elements are {@code null}
