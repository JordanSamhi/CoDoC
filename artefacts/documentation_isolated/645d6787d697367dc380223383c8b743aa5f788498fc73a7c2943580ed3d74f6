     * <strong>Denigrated</strong>, use {@linkplain #setIssuer(X500Principal)}
     * or {@linkplain #setIssuer(byte[])} instead. This method should not be
     * relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
     * encoding information in the
     * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt">RFC 2253</a> String form
     * of some distinguished names.
     * <p>
     * Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name
     * must match the issuer distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509Certificate}. If {@code null}, any issuer
     * distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If {@code issuerDN} is not {@code null}, it should contain a
     * distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

     * @param issuerDN a distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
     *                 (or {@code null})
     * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs (incorrect form for DN)
