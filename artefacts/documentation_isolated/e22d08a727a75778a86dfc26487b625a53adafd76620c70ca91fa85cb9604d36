     * Creates an Executor that uses a single worker thread operating
     * off an unbounded queue, and uses the provided ThreadFactory to
     * create a new thread when needed. Unlike the otherwise
     * equivalent {@code newFixedThreadPool(1, threadFactory)} the
     * returned executor is guaranteed not to be reconfigurable to use
     * additional threads.
     *
     * @param threadFactory the factory to use when creating new
     * threads
     *
     * @return the newly created single-threaded Executor
     * @throws NullPointerException if threadFactory is null
