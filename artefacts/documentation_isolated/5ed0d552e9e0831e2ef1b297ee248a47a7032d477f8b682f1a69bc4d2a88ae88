     * Forcibly terminates the currently running Java virtual machine.  This
     * method never returns normally.
     *
     * <p> This method should be used with extreme caution.  Unlike the
     * <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt> method, this method does not cause shutdown
     * hooks to be started and does not run uninvoked finalizers if
     * finalization-on-exit has been enabled.  If the shutdown sequence has
     * already been initiated then this method does not wait for any running
     * shutdown hooks or finalizers to finish their work. <p>
     *
     * @param  status
     *         Termination status.  By convention, a nonzero status code
     *         indicates abnormal termination.  If the <tt>{@link Runtime#exit
     *         exit}</tt> (equivalently, <tt>{@link System#exit(int)
     *         System.exit}</tt>) method has already been invoked then this
     *         status code will override the status code passed to that method.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *         If a security manager is present and its <tt>{@link
     *         SecurityManager#checkExit checkExit}</tt> method does not permit
     *         an exit with the specified status
