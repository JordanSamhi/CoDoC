     * Returns a string representation of the {@code double}
     * argument. All characters mentioned below are ASCII characters.
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the argument is NaN, the result is the string
     *     "{@code NaN}".
     * <li>Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
     * magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative,
     * the first character of the result is '{@code -}'
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002D'}); if the sign is positive, no sign character
     * appears in the result. As for the magnitude <i>m</i>:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is infinity, it is represented by the characters
     * {@code "Infinity"}; thus, positive infinity produces the result
     * {@code "Infinity"} and negative infinity produces the result
     * {@code "-Infinity"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is zero, it is represented by the characters
     * {@code "0.0"}; thus, negative zero produces the result
     * {@code "-0.0"} and positive zero produces the result
     * {@code "0.0"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is greater than or equal to 10<sup>-3</sup> but less
     * than 10<sup>7</sup>, then it is represented as the integer part of
     * <i>m</i>, in decimal form with no leading zeroes, followed by
     * '{@code .}' ({@code '\u005Cu002E'}), followed by one or
     * more decimal digits representing the fractional part of <i>m</i>.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is less than 10<sup>-3</sup> or greater than or
     * equal to 10<sup>7</sup>, then it is represented in so-called
     * "computerized scientific notation." Let <i>n</i> be the unique
     * integer such that 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> &le; <i>m</i> {@literal <}
     * 10<sup><i>n</i>+1</sup>; then let <i>a</i> be the
     * mathematically exact quotient of <i>m</i> and
     * 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> so that 1 &le; <i>a</i> {@literal <} 10. The
     * magnitude is then represented as the integer part of <i>a</i>,
     * as a single decimal digit, followed by '{@code .}'
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002E'}), followed by decimal digits
     * representing the fractional part of <i>a</i>, followed by the
     * letter '{@code E}' ({@code '\u005Cu0045'}), followed
     * by a representation of <i>n</i> as a decimal integer, as
     * produced by the method {@link Integer#toString(int)}.
     * </ul>
     * </ul>
     * How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of
     * <i>m</i> or <i>a</i>? There must be at least one digit to represent
     * the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more
     * digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from
     * adjacent values of type {@code double}. That is, suppose that
     * <i>x</i> is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal
     * representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument
     * <i>d</i>. Then <i>d</i> must be the {@code double} value nearest
     * to <i>x</i>; or if two {@code double} values are equally close
     * to <i>x</i>, then <i>d</i> must be one of them and the least
     * significant bit of the significand of <i>d</i> must be {@code 0}.
     *
     * <p>To create localized string representations of a floating-point
     * value, use subclasses of {@link java.text.NumberFormat}.
     *
     * @param   d   the {@code double} to be converted.
     * @return a string representation of the argument.
