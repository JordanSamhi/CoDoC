     * Trims the capacity of this vector to be the vector's current
     * size. If the capacity of this vector is larger than its current
     * size, then the capacity is changed to equal the size by replacing
     * its internal data array, kept in the field {@code elementData},
     * with a smaller one. An application can use this operation to
     * minimize the storage of a vector.
