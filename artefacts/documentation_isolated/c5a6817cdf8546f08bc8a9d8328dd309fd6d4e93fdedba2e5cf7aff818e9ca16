     * Returns a {@link Set} view of the mappings contained in this map.
     * The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
     * reflected in the set, and vice-versa.  The set supports element
     * removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map,
     * via the {@code Iterator.remove}, {@code Set.remove},
     * {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll}, and {@code clear}
     * operations.
     *
     * <p>The view's iterators and spliterators are
     * <a href="package-summary.html#Weakly"><i>weakly consistent</i></a>.
     *
     * <p>The view's {@code spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#CONCURRENT},
     * {@link Spliterator#DISTINCT}, and {@link Spliterator#NONNULL}.
     *
