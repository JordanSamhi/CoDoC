     * Updates a file's last modified time attribute. The file time is converted
     * to the epoch and precision supported by the file system. Converting from
     * finer to coarser granularities result in precision loss. The behavior of
     * this method when attempting to set the last modified time when it is not
     * supported by the file system or is outside the range supported by the
     * underlying file store is not defined. It may or not fail by throwing an
     * {@code IOException}.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
     * Suppose we want to set the last modified time to the current time:
     * <pre>
     *    Path path = ...
     *    FileTime now = FileTime.fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
     *    Files.setLastModifiedTime(path, now);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   time
     *          the new last modified time
     *
     * @return  the path
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, the security manager's {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite} method is invoked
     *          to check write access to file
     *
