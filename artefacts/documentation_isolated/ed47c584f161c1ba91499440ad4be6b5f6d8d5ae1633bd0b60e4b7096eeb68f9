     * Appends the fractional value of a date-time field to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * The fractional value of the field will be output including the
     * preceding decimal point. The preceding value is not output.
     * For example, the second-of-minute value of 15 would be output as {@code .25}.
     * <p>
     * The width of the printed fraction can be controlled. Setting the
     * minimum width to zero will cause no output to be generated.
     * The printed fraction will have the minimum width necessary between
     * the minimum and maximum widths - trailing zeroes are omitted.
     * No rounding occurs due to the maximum width - digits are simply dropped.
     * <p>
     * When parsing in strict mode, the number of parsed digits must be between
     * the minimum and maximum width. When parsing in lenient mode, the minimum
     * width is considered to be zero and the maximum is nine.
     * <p>
     * If the value cannot be obtained then an exception will be thrown.
     * If the value is negative an exception will be thrown.
     * If the field does not have a fixed set of valid values then an
     * exception will be thrown.
     * If the field value in the date-time to be printed is invalid it
     * cannot be printed and an exception will be thrown.
     *
     * @param field  the field to append, not null
     * @param minWidth  the minimum width of the field excluding the decimal point, from 0 to 9
     * @param maxWidth  the maximum width of the field excluding the decimal point, from 1 to 9
     * @param decimalPoint  whether to output the localized decimal point symbol
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the field has a variable set of valid values or
     *  either width is invalid
