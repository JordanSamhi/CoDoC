     * <p> The {@code options} parameter may be used to indicate how symbolic links

     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.

     * <p> Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this
     * method indicates the file exists then there is no guarantee that a
     * subsequence access will succeed. Care should be taken when using this
