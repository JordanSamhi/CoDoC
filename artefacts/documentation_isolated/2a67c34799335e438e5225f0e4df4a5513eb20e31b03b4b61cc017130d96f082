     * Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
     * certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate
     * is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
     * fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
     * in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
     * included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
     * certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX
     * {@code CertPathBuilder} instance must not build
     * paths longer than the length specified.
     *
     * <p> A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
     * a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
     * path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
     * The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
     * Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.
     *
     * <p> If any of the CA certificates contain the
     * {@code BasicConstraintsExtension}, the value of the
     * {@code pathLenConstraint} field of the extension overrides
     * the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
     * certification path of smaller length.
