     * <p> An invocation of this method of the form <tt>out.append(csq)</tt>
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     *
     * <pre>
     *     out.print(csq.toString()) </pre>
     *
     * <p> Depending on the specification of <tt>toString</tt> for the
     * character sequence <tt>csq</tt>, the entire sequence may not be
     * appended.  For instance, invoking then <tt>toString</tt> method of a
     * character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon
     * the buffer's position and limit.
     *
     * @param  csq
     *         The character sequence to append.  If <tt>csq</tt> is
     *         <tt>null</tt>, then the four characters <tt>"null"</tt> are
     *         appended to this output stream.
