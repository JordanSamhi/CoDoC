     * This method will be invoked when the current page is scrolled, either as part
     * of a programmatically initiated smooth scroll or a user initiated touch scroll.
     * If you override this method you must call through to the superclass implementation
     * (e.g. super.onPageScrolled(position, offset, offsetPixels)) before onPageScrolled
     * returns.
     *
     * @param position Position index of the first page currently being displayed.
     *                 Page position+1 will be visible if positionOffset is nonzero.
     * @param offset Value from [0, 1) indicating the offset from the page at position.
     * @param offsetPixels Value in pixels indicating the offset from position.
