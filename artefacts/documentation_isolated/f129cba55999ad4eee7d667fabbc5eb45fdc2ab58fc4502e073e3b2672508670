     * Writes <code>len</code> bytes from the specified byte array
     * starting at offset <code>off</code> to this output stream.
     * The general contract for <code>write(b, off, len)</code> is that
     * some of the bytes in the array <code>b</code> are written to the
     * output stream in order; element <code>b[off]</code> is the first
     * byte written and <code>b[off+len-1]</code> is the last byte written
     * by this operation.
     * <p>
     * The <code>write</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code> calls
     * the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be
     * written out. Subclasses are encouraged to override this method and
     * provide a more efficient implementation.
     * <p>
     * If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>, a
     * <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If <code>off</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is negative, or
     * <code>off+len</code> is greater than the length of the array
     * <code>b</code>, then an <tt>IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt> is thrown.
     *
     * @param      b     the data.
     * @param      off   the start offset in the data.
     * @param      len   the number of bytes to write.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs. In particular,
     *             an <code>IOException</code> is thrown if the output
     *             stream is closed.
