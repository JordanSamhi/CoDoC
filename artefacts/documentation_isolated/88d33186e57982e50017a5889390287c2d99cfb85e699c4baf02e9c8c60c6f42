     * Produces an adapter method handle which adapts the type of the
     * current method handle to a new type.
     * The resulting method handle is guaranteed to report a type
     * which is equal to the desired new type.
     * <p>
     * If the original type and new type are equal, returns {@code this}.
     * <p>
     * The new method handle, when invoked, will perform the following
     * steps:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Convert the incoming argument list to match the original
     *     method handle's argument list.
     * <li>Invoke the original method handle on the converted argument list.
     * <li>Convert any result returned by the original method handle
     *     to the return type of new method handle.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This method provides the crucial behavioral difference between
     * {@link #invokeExact invokeExact} and plain, inexact {@link #invoke invoke}.
     * The two methods
     * perform the same steps when the caller's type descriptor exactly m atches
     * the callee's, but when the types differ, plain {@link #invoke invoke}
     * also calls {@code asType} (or some internal equivalent) in order
     * to match up the caller's and callee's types.
     * <p>
     * If the current method is a variable arity method handle
     * argument list conversion may involve the conversion and collection
     * of several arguments into an array, as
     * {@linkplain #asVarargsCollector described elsewhere}.
     * In every other case, all conversions are applied <em>pairwise</em>,
     * which means that each argument or return value is converted to
     * exactly one argument or return value (or no return value).
     * The applied conversions are defined by consulting the
     * the corresponding component types of the old and new
     * method handle types.
     * <p>
     * Let <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> be corresponding new and old parameter types,
     * or old and new return types.  Specifically, for some valid index {@code i}, let
     * <em>T0</em>{@code =newType.parameterType(i)} and <em>T1</em>{@code =this.type().parameterType(i)}.
     * Or else, going the other way for return values, let
     * <em>T0</em>{@code =this.type().returnType()} and <em>T1</em>{@code =newType.returnType()}.
     * If the types are the same, the new method handle makes no change
     * to the corresponding argument or return value (if any).
     * Otherwise, one of the following conversions is applied
     * if possible:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are references, then a cast to <em>T1</em> is applied.
     *     (The types do not need to be related in any particular way.
     *     This is because a dynamic value of null can convert to any reference type.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are primitives, then a Java method invocation
     *     conversion (JLS 5.3) is applied, if one exists.
     *     (Specifically, <em>T0</em> must convert to <em>T1</em> by a widening primitive conversion.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a primitive and <em>T1</em> a reference,
     *     a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied if one exists.
     *     (Specifically, the value is boxed from <em>T0</em> to its wrapper class,
     *     which is then widened as needed to <em>T1</em>.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a reference and <em>T1</em> a primitive, an unboxing
     *     conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
     *     by a Java method invocation conversion (JLS 5.3)
     *     on the primitive value.  (These are the primitive widening conversions.)
     *     <em>T0</em> must be a wrapper class or a supertype of one.
     *     (In the case where <em>T0</em> is Object, these are the conversions
     *     allowed by {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke}.)
     *     The unboxing conversion must have a possibility of success, which means that
     *     if <em>T0</em> is not itself a wrapper class, there must exist at least one
     *     wrapper class <em>TW</em> which is a subtype of <em>T0</em> and whose unboxed
     *     primitive value can be widened to <em>T1</em>.
     * <li>If the return type <em>T1</em> is marked as void, any returned value is discarded
     * <li>If the return type <em>T0</em> is void and <em>T1</em> a reference, a null value is introduced.
     * <li>If the return type <em>T0</em> is void and <em>T1</em> a primitive,
     *     a zero value is introduced.
     * </ul>
     * (<em>Note:</em> Both <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> may be regarded as static types,
     * because neither corresponds specifically to the <em>dynamic type</em> of any
     * actual argument or return value.)
     * <p>
     * The method handle conversion cannot be made if any one of the required
     * pairwise conversions cannot be made.
     * <p>
     * At runtime, the conversions applied to reference arguments
     * or return values may require additional runtime checks which can fail.
     * An unboxing operation may fail because the original reference is null,
     * causing a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException}.
     * An unboxing operation or a reference cast may also fail on a reference
     * to an object of the wrong type,
     * causing a {@link java.lang.ClassCastException ClassCastException}.
     * Although an unboxing operation may accept several kinds of wrappers,
     * if none are available, a {@code ClassCastException} will be thrown.
