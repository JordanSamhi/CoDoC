     * Returns the scheme component of this URI.
     *
     * <p> The scheme component of a URI, if defined, only contains characters
     * in the <i>alphanum</i> category and in the string {@code "-.+"}.  A
     * scheme always starts with an <i>alpha</i> character. <p>
     *
     * The scheme component of a URI cannot contain escaped octets, hence this
     * method does not perform any decoding.
     *
     * @return  The scheme component of this URI,
     *          or {@code null} if the scheme is undefined
