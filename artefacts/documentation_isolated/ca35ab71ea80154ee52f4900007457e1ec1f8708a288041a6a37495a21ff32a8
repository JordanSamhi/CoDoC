     * The "propagationId" field is reserved for future use.  In Beans 1.0
     * the sole requirement is that if a listener catches a PropertyChangeEvent
     * and then fires a PropertyChangeEvent of its own, then it should
     * make sure that it propagates the propagationId field from its
     * incoming event to its outgoing event.
     *
     * @return the propagationId object associated with a bound/constrained
     *          property update.
