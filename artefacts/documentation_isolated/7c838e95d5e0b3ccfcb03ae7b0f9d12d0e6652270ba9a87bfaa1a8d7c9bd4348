     * Returns a {@code Double} instance representing the specified
     * {@code double} value.
     * If a new {@code Double} instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Double(double)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance by caching
     * frequently requested values.
