     * Returns a {@code Short} instance representing the specified
     * {@code short} value.
     * If a new {@code Short} instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Short(short)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance by caching
     * frequently requested values.
     *
     * This method will always cache values in the range -128 to 127,
     * inclusive, and may cache other values outside of this range.
     *
     * @param  s a short value.
     * @return a {@code Short} instance representing {@code s}.
