     * Returns the floor modulus of the {@code long} arguments.
     * <p>
     * The floor modulus is {@code x - (floorDiv(x, y) * y)},
     * has the same sign as the divisor {@code y}, and
     * is in the range of {@code -abs(y) < r < +abs(y)}.
     * <p>
     * The relationship between {@code floorDiv} and {@code floorMod} is such that:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code floorDiv(x, y) * y + floorMod(x, y) == x}
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * See {@link Math#floorMod(int, int) Math.floorMod} for examples and
     * a comparison to the {@code %} operator.
