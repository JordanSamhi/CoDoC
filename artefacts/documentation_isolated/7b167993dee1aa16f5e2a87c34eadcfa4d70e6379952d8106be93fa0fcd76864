     * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the specified number of hours added.
     * <p>
     * This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one hour will
     * always be a duration of one hour later.
     * This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
     * Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
     * thus adding one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a time-zone where the spring DST cutover means that the
     * local times 01:00 to 01:59 occur twice changing from offset +02:00 to +01:00.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Adding one hour to 00:30+02:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
     * <li>Adding one hour to 01:30+02:00 will result in 01:30+01:00
     * <li>Adding one hour to 01:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
     * <li>Adding three hours to 00:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

     * @param hours  the hours to add, may be negative
