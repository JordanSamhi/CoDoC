     * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
     * system clock, converting to date and time using the UTC time-zone.
     * <p>
     * This clock, rather than {@link #systemDefaultZone()}, should be used when
     * you need the current instant without the date or time.
     * <p>
     * This clock is based on the best available system clock.
     * This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher resolution
     * clock if one is available.
     * <p>
     * Conversion from instant to date or time uses the {@linkplain ZoneOffset#UTC UTC time-zone}.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
     * It is equivalent to {@code system(ZoneOffset.UTC)}.
     *
     * @return a clock that uses the best available system clock in the UTC zone, not null
