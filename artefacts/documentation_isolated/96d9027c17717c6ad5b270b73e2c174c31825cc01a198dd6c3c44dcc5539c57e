     * Appends an instant using ISO-8601 to the formatter, formatting fractional
     * digits in groups of three.
     * <p>
     * Instants have a fixed output format.
     * They are converted to a date-time with a zone-offset of UTC and formatted
     * using the standard ISO-8601 format.
     * With this method, formatting nano-of-second outputs zero, three, six
     * or nine digits digits as necessary.
     * The localized decimal style is not used.
     * <p>
     * The instant is obtained using {@link ChronoField#INSTANT_SECONDS INSTANT_SECONDS}
     * and optionally (@code NANO_OF_SECOND). The value of {@code INSTANT_SECONDS}
     * may be outside the maximum range of {@code LocalDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * The {@linkplain ResolverStyle resolver style} has no effect on instant parsing.
     * The end-of-day time of '24:00' is handled as midnight at the start of the following day.
     * The leap-second time of '23:59:59' is handled to some degree, see
     * {@link DateTimeFormatter#parsedLeapSecond()} for full details.
     * <p>
     * An alternative to this method is to format/parse the instant as a single
     * epoch-seconds value. That is achieved using {@code appendValue(INSTANT_SECONDS)}.

     * @return this, for chaining, not null
