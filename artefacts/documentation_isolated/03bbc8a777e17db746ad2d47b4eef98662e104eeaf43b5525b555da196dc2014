     * Returns an iteration of the {@code CertPath} encodings supported
     * by this certificate factory, with the default encoding first. See
     * the CertPath Encodings section in the <a href=
     * "{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#CertPathEncodings">
     * Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation</a>
     * for information about standard encoding names.
     * <p>
     * Attempts to modify the returned {@code Iterator} via its
     * {@code remove} method result in an
     * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * <p> This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform
     * Standard Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with
     * existing service providers, this method cannot be {@code abstract}
     * and by default throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @return an {@code Iterator} over the names of the supported
     *         {@code CertPath} encodings (as {@code String}s)
     * @exception UnsupportedOperationException if the method is not supported
     * @since 1.4
