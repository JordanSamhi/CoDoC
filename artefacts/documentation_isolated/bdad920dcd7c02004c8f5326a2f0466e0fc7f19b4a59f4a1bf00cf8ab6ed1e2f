     * Obtains a {@code Period} from a text string such as {@code PnYnMnD}.
     * <p>
     * This will parse the string produced by {@code toString()} which is
     * based on the ISO-8601 period formats {@code PnYnMnD} and {@code PnW}.
     * <p>
     * The string starts with an optional sign, denoted by the ASCII negative
     * or positive symbol. If negative, the whole period is negated.
     * The ASCII letter "P" is next in upper or lower case.
     * There are then four sections, each consisting of a number and a suffix.
     * At least one of the four sections must be present.
     * The sections have suffixes in ASCII of "Y", "M", "W" and "D" for
     * years, months, weeks and days, accepted in upper or lower case.
     * The suffixes must occur in order.
     * The number part of each section must consist of ASCII digits.
     * The number may be prefixed by the ASCII negative or positive symbol.
     * The number must parse to an {@code int}.
     * <p>
     * The leading plus/minus sign, and negative values for other units are
     * not part of the ISO-8601 standard. In addition, ISO-8601 does not
     * permit mixing between the {@code PnYnMnD} and {@code PnW} formats.
     * Any week-based input is multiplied by 7 and treated as a number of days.
     * <p>
     * For example, the following are valid inputs:
     * <pre>
     *   "P2Y"             -- Period.ofYears(2)
     *   "P3M"             -- Period.ofMonths(3)
     *   "P4W"             -- Period.ofWeeks(4)
     *   "P5D"             -- Period.ofDays(5)
     *   "P1Y2M3D"         -- Period.of(1, 2, 3)
     *   "P1Y2M3W4D"       -- Period.of(1, 2, 25)
     *   "P-1Y2M"          -- Period.of(-1, 2, 0)
     *   "-P1Y2M"          -- Period.of(-1, -2, 0)
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param text  the text to parse, not null
     * @return the parsed period, not null
     * @throws DateTimeParseException if the text cannot be parsed to a period
