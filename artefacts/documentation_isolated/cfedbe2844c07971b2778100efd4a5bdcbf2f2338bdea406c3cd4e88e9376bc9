     * Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
     * inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive.  (If fromIndex and toIndex are
     * equal, the returned List is empty.)  The returned List is backed by this
     * List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
     * vice-versa.  The returned List supports all of the optional List
     * operations supported by this List.
     *
     * <p>This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
     * the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects
     * a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
     * instead of a whole List.  For example, the following idiom
     * removes a range of elements from a List:
     * <pre>
     *      list.subList(from, to).clear();
     * </pre>
     * Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
     * and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
     * a subList.
     *
     * <p>The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
     * the backing list (i.e., this List) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
     * any way other than via the returned List.  (Structural modifications are
     * those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
     * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

     * @param fromIndex low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
