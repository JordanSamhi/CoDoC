     * Creates a {@code Spliterator} over the elements in this set.
     *
     * <p>The {@code Spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#DISTINCT}.
     * Implementations should document the reporting of additional
     * characteristic values.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation creates a
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em> spliterator
     * from the set's {@code Iterator}.  The spliterator inherits the
     * <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the set's iterator.
     * <p>
     * The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link Spliterator#SIZED}.
     *
     * @implNote
     * The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link Spliterator#SUBSIZED}.
