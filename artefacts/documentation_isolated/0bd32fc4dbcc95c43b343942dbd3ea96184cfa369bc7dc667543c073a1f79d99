     * <p>This is a convenience method.  An invocation of the form
     * {@code redirectInput(file)}
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     * {@link #redirectInput(Redirect) redirectInput}
     * {@code (Redirect.from(file))}.
     *
     * @param  file the new standard input source
     * @return this process builder
