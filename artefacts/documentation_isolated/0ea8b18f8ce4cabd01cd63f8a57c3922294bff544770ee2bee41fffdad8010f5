     * Skips over and discards <code>n</code> bytes of data from this
     * input stream. The <code>skip</code> method may, for a variety of
     * reasons, end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes,
     * possibly zero.  If <code>n</code> is negative, no bytes are skipped.
     *
     * <p> The <code>skip</code> method of <code>PushbackInputStream</code>
     * first skips over the bytes in the pushback buffer, if any.  It then
     * calls the <code>skip</code> method of the underlying input stream if
     * more bytes need to be skipped.  The actual number of bytes skipped
     * is returned.
