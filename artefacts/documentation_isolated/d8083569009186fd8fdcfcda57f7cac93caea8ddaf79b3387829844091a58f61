     * Starts this animation. If the animation has a nonzero startDelay, the animation will start
     * running after that delay elapses. A non-delayed animation will have its initial
     * value(s) set immediately, followed by calls to
     * {@link AnimatorListener#onAnimationStart(Animator)} for any listeners of this animator.
     *
     * <p>The animation started by calling this method will be run on the thread that called
     * this method. This thread should have a Looper on it (a runtime exception will be thrown if
     * this is not the case). Also, if the animation will animate
     * properties of objects in the view hierarchy, then the calling thread should be the UI
     * thread for that view hierarchy.</p>
