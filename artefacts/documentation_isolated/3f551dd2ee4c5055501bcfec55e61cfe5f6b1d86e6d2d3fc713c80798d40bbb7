     * Adapts a {@code Collector} accepting elements of type {@code U} to one
     * accepting elements of type {@code T} by applying a mapping function to
     * each input element before accumulation.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * The {@code mapping()} collectors are most useful when used in a
     * multi-level reduction, such as downstream of a {@code groupingBy} or
     * {@code partitioningBy}.  For example, given a stream of
     * {@code Person}, to accumulate the set of last names in each city:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Map<City, Set<String>> lastNamesByCity
     *         = people.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getCity,
     *                                              mapping(Person::getLastName, toSet())));
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param <U> type of elements accepted by downstream collector
     * @param <A> intermediate accumulation type of the downstream collector
     * @param <R> result type of collector
     * @param mapper a function to be applied to the input elements
     * @param downstream a collector which will accept mapped values
     * @return a collector which applies the mapping function to the input
     * elements and provides the mapped results to the downstream collector
