     * Creates a single-threaded executor that can schedule commands
     * to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.  (Note
     * however that if this single thread terminates due to a failure
     * during execution prior to shutdown, a new one will take its
     * place if needed to execute subsequent tasks.)  Tasks are
     * guaranteed to execute sequentially, and no more than one task
     * will be active at any given time. Unlike the otherwise
     * equivalent {@code newScheduledThreadPool(1, threadFactory)}
     * the returned executor is guaranteed not to be reconfigurable to
     * use additional threads.
     * @param threadFactory the factory to use when creating new
     * threads
     * @return a newly created scheduled executor
     * @throws NullPointerException if threadFactory is null
