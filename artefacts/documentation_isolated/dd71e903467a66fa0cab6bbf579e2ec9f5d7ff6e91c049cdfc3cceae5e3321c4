     * Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime} formed from this date-time at the
     * specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
     * Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
     * is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
     * <p>
     * The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
     * This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
     * date-time as defined by the {@link ZoneRules rules} of the zone ID.
     *<p>
     * In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
     * In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
     * This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".
     * <p>
     * In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
     * Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
     * For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
     * moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
     * <p>
     * To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call
     * {@link ZonedDateTime#withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()} on the result of this method.
     * To throw an exception when there is a gap or overlap, use
     * {@link ZonedDateTime#ofStrict(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)}.

     * @param zone  the time-zone to use, not null
