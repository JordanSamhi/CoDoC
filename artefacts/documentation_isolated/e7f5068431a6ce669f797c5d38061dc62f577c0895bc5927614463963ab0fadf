     * Disable/Enable local loopback of multicast datagrams
     * The option is used by the platform's networking code as a hint
     * for setting whether multicast data will be looped back to
     * the local socket.
     *
     * <p>Because this option is a hint, applications that want to
     * verify what loopback mode is set to should call
     * {@link #getLoopbackMode()}
     * @param disable {@code true} to disable the LoopbackMode
     * @throws SocketException if an error occurs while setting the value
     * @since 1.4
     * @see #getLoopbackMode
