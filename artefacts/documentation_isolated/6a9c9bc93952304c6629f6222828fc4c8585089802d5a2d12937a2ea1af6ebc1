     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} from an {@code Instant}.
     * <p>
     * This creates a zoned date-time with the same instant as that specified.
     * Calling {@link #toInstant()} will return an instant equal to the one used here.
     * <p>
     * Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
     * offset for each instant.
     *
     * @param instant  the instant to create the date-time from, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported range
