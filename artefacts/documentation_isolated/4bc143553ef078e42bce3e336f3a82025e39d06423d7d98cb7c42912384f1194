     * Queries if this lock is held by the current thread.
     *
     * <p>Analogous to the {@link Thread#holdsLock(Object)} method for
     * built-in monitor locks, this method is typically used for
     * debugging and testing. For example, a method that should only be
     * called while a lock is held can assert that this is the case:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * class X {
     *   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
     *   // ...
     *
     *   public void m() {
     *       assert lock.isHeldByCurrentThread();
     *       // ... method body
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>It can also be used to ensure that a reentrant lock is used
     * in a non-reentrant manner, for example:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * class X {
     *   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
     *   // ...
     *
     *   public void m() {
     *       assert !lock.isHeldByCurrentThread();
     *       lock.lock();
     *       try {
     *           // ... method body
     *       } finally {
     *           lock.unlock();
     *       }
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if current thread holds this lock and
     *         {@code false} otherwise
