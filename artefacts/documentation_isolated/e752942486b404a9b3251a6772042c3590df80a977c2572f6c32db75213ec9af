     * Constructs a reader that decodes bytes from the given channel according
     * to the named charset.

     * <p> An invocation of this method of the form
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Channels.newReader(ch, csname)</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the expression
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Channels.newReader(ch,
     *                    Charset.forName(csName)

     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel from which bytes will be read
     *
     * @param  csName
     *         The name of the charset to be used
     *
     * @return  A new reader
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedCharsetException
     *          If no support for the named charset is available
     *          in this instance of the Java virtual machine
