     * Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the
     * previous match operation.
     *
     * <p> For a matcher <i>m</i>, input sequence <i>s</i>, and group index
     * <i>g</i>, the expressions <i>m.</i><tt>group(</tt><i>g</i><tt>)</tt> and
     * <i>s.</i><tt>substring(</tt><i>m.</i><tt>start(</tt><i>g</i><tt>),</tt>&nbsp;<i>m.</i><tt>end(</tt><i>g</i><tt>))</tt>
     * are equivalent.  </p>
     *
     * <p> <a href="Pattern.html#cg">Capturing groups</a> are indexed from left
     * to right, starting at one.  Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
     * the expression <tt>m.group(0)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>m.group()</tt>.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p> If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
     * any part of the input sequence, then <tt>null</tt> is returned. Note
     * that some groups, for example <tt>(a*)</tt>, match the empty string.
     * This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
     * matches the empty string in the input.  </p>
     *
     * @param  group
     *         The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern
     *
     * @return  The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group
     *          during the previous match, or <tt>null</tt> if the group
     *          failed to match part of the input
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          If no match has yet been attempted,
     *          or if the previous match operation failed
     *
     * @throws  IndexOutOfBoundsException
     *          If there is no capturing group in the pattern
     *          with the given index
