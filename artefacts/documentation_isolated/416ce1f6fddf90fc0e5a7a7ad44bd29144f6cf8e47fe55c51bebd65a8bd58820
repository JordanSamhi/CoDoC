     * Returns the last in month adjuster, which returns a new date
     * in the same month with the last matching day-of-week.
     * This is used for expressions like 'last Tuesday in March'.
     * <p>
     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (MONDAY) will return 2011-12-26.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (FRIDAY) will return 2011-12-30.<br>
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} fields
     * and the {@code DAYS} unit, and assumes a seven day week.
     *
     * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week, not null
     * @return the first in month adjuster, not null
