     * Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified sorted set.  This method
     * allows modules to provide users with "read-only" access to internal
     * sorted sets.  Query operations on the returned sorted set "read
     * through" to the specified sorted set.  Attempts to modify the returned
     * sorted set, whether direct, via its iterator, or via its
     * <tt>subSet</tt>, <tt>headSet</tt>, or <tt>tailSet</tt> views, result in
     * an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.<p>
     *
     * The returned sorted set will be serializable if the specified sorted set
     * is serializable.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the set
     * @param s the sorted set for which an unmodifiable view is to be
     *        returned.
     * @return an unmodifiable view of the specified sorted set.
