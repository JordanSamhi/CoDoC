     * Note that case sensitivity is set separately to this method.
     * <p>
     * Parsing can be strict or lenient - by default its strict.
     * This controls the degree of flexibility in matching the text and sign styles.
     * Applications calling this method should typically also call {@link #parseCaseInsensitive()}.
     * <p>
     * When used, this method changes the parsing to be lenient from this point onwards.
     * The change will remain in force until the end of the formatter that is eventually
     * constructed or until {@code parseStrict} is called.

     * @return this, for chaining, not null
