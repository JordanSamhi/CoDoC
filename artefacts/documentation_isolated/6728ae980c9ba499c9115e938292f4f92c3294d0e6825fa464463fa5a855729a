     * Write lines of text to a file. Characters are encoded into bytes using
     * the {@link StandardCharsets#UTF_8 UTF-8} {@link Charset charset}.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <pre>{@code
     * Files.write(path, lines, StandardCharsets.UTF_8, options);
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   lines
     *          an object to iterate over the char sequences
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  the path
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs writing to or creating the file, or the
     *          text cannot be encoded as {@code UTF-8}
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
