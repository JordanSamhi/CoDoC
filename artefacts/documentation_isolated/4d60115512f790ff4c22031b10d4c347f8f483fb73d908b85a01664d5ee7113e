     * Returns an adjusted copy of this time.
     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code OffsetTime}, based on this one, with the time adjusted.
     * The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
     * Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
     * <p>
     * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the hour field.
     * A more complex adjuster might set the time to the last hour of the day.
     * <p>
     * The classes {@link LocalTime} and {@link ZoneOffset} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
     * thus this method can be used to change the time or offset:
     * <pre>
     *  result = offsetTime.with(time);
     *  result = offsetTime.with(offset);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
     * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
     * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param adjuster the adjuster to use, not null
     * @return an {@code OffsetTime} based on {@code this} with the adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the adjustment cannot be made
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
