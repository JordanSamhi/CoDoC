     * Performs an action when method {@link
     * #completeExceptionally(Throwable)} is invoked or method {@link
     * #compute} throws an exception, and this task has not already
     * otherwise completed normally. On entry to this method, this task
     * {@link ForkJoinTask#isCompletedAbnormally}.  The return value
     * of this method controls further propagation: If {@code true}
     * and this task has a completer that has not completed, then that
     * completer is also completed exceptionally, with the same
     * exception as this completer.  The default implementation of
     * this method does nothing except return {@code true}.
     *
     * @param ex the exception
     * @param caller the task invoking this method (which may
     * be this task itself)
     * @return {@code true} if this exception should be propagated to this
     * task's completer, if one exists
