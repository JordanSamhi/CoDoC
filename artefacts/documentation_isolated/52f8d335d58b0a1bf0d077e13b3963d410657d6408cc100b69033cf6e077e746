     * Returns a copy of this formatter with a new override chronology.
     * <p>
     * This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but
     * with the override chronology set.
     * By default, a formatter has no override chronology, returning null.
     * <p>
     * If an override is added, then any date that is formatted or parsed will be affected.
     * <p>
     * When formatting, if the temporal object contains a date, then it will
     * be converted to a date in the override chronology.
     * Whether the temporal contains a date is determined by querying the
     * {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY EPOCH_DAY} field.
     * Any time or zone will be retained unaltered unless overridden.
     * <p>
     * If the temporal object does not contain a date, but does contain one
     * or more {@code ChronoField} date fields, then a {@code DateTimeException}
     * is thrown. In all other cases, the override chronology is added to the temporal,
     * replacing any previous chronology, but without changing the date/time.
     * <p>
     * When parsing, there are two distinct cases to consider.
     * If a chronology has been parsed directly from the text, perhaps because
     * {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#appendChronologyId()} was used, then
     * this override chronology has no effect.
     * If no zone has been parsed, then this override chronology will be used
     * to interpret the {@code ChronoField} values into a date according to the
     * date resolving rules of the chronology.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param chrono  the new chronology, null if no override
     * @return a formatter based on this formatter with the requested override chronology, not null
