     * Returns the character (Unicode code point) before the specified
     * index. The index refers to {@code char} values
     * (Unicode code units) and ranges from {@code 1} to {@link
     * CharSequence#length() length}.
     *
     * <p> If the {@code char} value at {@code (index - 1)}
     * is in the low-surrogate range, {@code (index - 2)} is not
     * negative, and the {@code char} value at {@code (index -
     * 2)} is in the high-surrogate range, then the
     * supplementary code point value of the surrogate pair is
     * returned. If the {@code char} value at {@code index -
     * 1} is an unpaired low-surrogate or a high-surrogate, the
     * surrogate value is returned.
     *
     * @param     index the index following the code point that should be returned
     * @return    the Unicode code point value before the given index.
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if the {@code index}
     *            argument is less than 1 or greater than the length
     *            of this string.
