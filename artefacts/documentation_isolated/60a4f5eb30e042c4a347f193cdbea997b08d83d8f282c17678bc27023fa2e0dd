     * Sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of this
     * file, at which the next read or write occurs.  The offset may be
     * set beyond the end of the file. Setting the offset beyond the end
     * of the file does not change the file length.  The file length will
     * change only by writing after the offset has been set beyond the end
     * of the file.

     * @param      pos   the offset position, measured in bytes from the

     *                   pointer.
