     * Appends the specified {@code StringBuffer} to this sequence.
     * <p>
     * The characters of the {@code StringBuffer} argument are appended,
     * in order, to this sequence, increasing the
     * length of this sequence by the length of the argument.
     * If {@code sb} is {@code null}, then the four characters
     * {@code "null"} are appended to this sequence.
     * <p>
     * Let <i>n</i> be the length of this character sequence just prior to
     * execution of the {@code append} method. Then the character at index
     * <i>k</i> in the new character sequence is equal to the character at
     * index <i>k</i> in the old character sequence, if <i>k</i> is less than
     * <i>n</i>; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index <i>k-n</i>
     * in the argument {@code sb}.
     *
     * @param   sb   the {@code StringBuffer} to append.
     * @return  a reference to this object.
