     * Creates an empty file in the default temporary-file directory, using
     * the given prefix and suffix to generate its name. The resulting {@code
     * Path} is associated with the default {@code FileSystem}.
     *
     * <p> This method works in exactly the manner specified by the
     * {@link #createTempFile(Path,String,String,FileAttribute[])} method for
     * the case that the {@code dir} parameter is the temporary-file directory.
     *
     * @param   prefix
     *          the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;
     *          may be {@code null}
     * @param   suffix
     *          the suffix string to be used in generating the file's name;
     *          may be {@code null}, in which case "{@code .tmp}" is used
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the file
     *
     * @return  the path to the newly created file that did not exist before
     *          this method was invoked
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the prefix or suffix parameters cannot be used to generate
     *          a candidate file name
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the directory
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or the temporary-file directory does not
     *          exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
