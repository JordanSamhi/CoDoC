     * Returns a {@code Map} containing all names of the calendar
     * {@code field} in the given {@code style} and
     * {@code locale} and their corresponding field values. For
     * example, if this {@code Calendar} is a {@link
     * GregorianCalendar}, the returned map would contain "Jan" to
     * {@link #JANUARY}, "Feb" to {@link #FEBRUARY}, and so on, in the
     * {@linkplain #SHORT short} style in an English locale.
     *
     * <p>Narrow names may not be unique due to use of single characters,
     * such as "S" for Sunday and Saturday. In that case narrow names are not
     * included in the returned {@code Map}.
     *
     * <p>The values of other calendar fields may be taken into
     * account to determine a set of display names. For example, if
     * this {@code Calendar} is a lunisolar calendar system and
     * the year value given by the {@link #YEAR} field has a leap
     * month, this method would return month names containing the leap
     * month name, and month names are mapped to their values specific
     * for the year.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation supports display names contained in
     * a {@link DateFormatSymbols}. For example, if {@code field}
     * is {@link #MONTH} and {@code style} is {@link
     * #ALL_STYLES}, this method returns a {@code Map} containing
     * all strings returned by {@link DateFormatSymbols#getShortMonths()}
     * and {@link DateFormatSymbols#getMonths()}.
     *
     * @param field
     *        the calendar field for which the display names are returned
     * @param style
     *        the style applied to the string representation; one of {@link
     *        #SHORT_FORMAT} ({@link #SHORT}), {@link #SHORT_STANDALONE},
     *        {@link #LONG_FORMAT} ({@link #LONG}), {@link #LONG_STANDALONE},
     *        {@link #NARROW_FORMAT}, or {@link #NARROW_STANDALONE}
     * @param locale
     *        the locale for the display names
     * @return a {@code Map} containing all display names in
     *        {@code style} and {@code locale} and their
     *        field values, or {@code null} if no display names
     *        are defined for {@code field}
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException
     *        if {@code field} or {@code style} is invalid,
     *        or if this {@code Calendar} is non-lenient and any
     *        of the calendar fields have invalid values
     * @exception NullPointerException
     *        if {@code locale} is null
