     * directly implemented by the class or interface represented by
     * this object.
     *
     * <p>If a superinterface is a parameterized type, the
     * {@code Type} object returned for it must accurately reflect
     * the actual type parameters used in the source code. The
     * parameterized type representing each superinterface is created
     * if it had not been created before. See the declaration of
     * {@link java.lang.reflect.ParameterizedType ParameterizedType}
     * for the semantics of the creation process for parameterized
     * types.
     *
     * <p> If this object represents a class, the return value is an
     * array containing objects representing all interfaces
     * implemented by the class. The order of the interface objects in
     * the array corresponds to the order of the interface names in
     * the {@code implements} clause of the declaration of the class
     * represented by this object.  In the case of an array class, the
     * interfaces {@code Cloneable} and {@code Serializable} are
     * returned in that order.
     *
     * <p>If this object represents an interface, the array contains
     * objects representing all interfaces directly extended by the
     * interface.  The order of the interface objects in the array
     * corresponds to the order of the interface names in the
     * {@code extends} clause of the declaration of the interface
     * represented by this object.
     *
     * <p>If this object represents a class or interface that
     * implements no interfaces, the method returns an array of length
     * 0.
     *
     * <p>If this object represents a primitive type or void, the
     * method returns an array of length 0.
