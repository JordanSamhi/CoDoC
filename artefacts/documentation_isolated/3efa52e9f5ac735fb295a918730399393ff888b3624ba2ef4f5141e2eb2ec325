     * Removes the provider with the specified name.
     *
     * <p>When the specified provider is removed, all providers located
     * at a position greater than where the specified provider was are shifted
     * down one position (towards the head of the list of installed
     * providers).
     *
     * <p>This method returns silently if the provider is not installed or
     * if name is null.
     *
     * <p>First, if there is a security manager, its
     * {@code checkSecurityAccess}
     * method is called with the string {@code "removeProvider."+name}
     * to see if it's ok to remove the provider.
     * If the default implementation of {@code checkSecurityAccess}
     * is used (i.e., that method is not overriden), then this will result in
     * a call to the security manager's {@code checkPermission} method
     * with a {@code SecurityPermission("removeProvider."+name)}
     * permission.
     *
     * @param name the name of the provider to remove.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkSecurityAccess} method
     *          denies
     *          access to remove the provider
