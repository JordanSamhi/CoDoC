     * Reads up to <code>len</code> bytes of data from the contained
     * input stream into an array of bytes.  An attempt is made to read
     * as many as <code>len</code> bytes, but a smaller number may be read,
     * possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an
     * integer.
     *
     * <p> This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
     * detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * <p> If <code>len</code> is zero, then no bytes are read and
     * <code>0</code> is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
     * least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
     * file, the value <code>-1</code> is returned; otherwise, at least one
     * byte is read and stored into <code>b</code>.
     *
     * <p> The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[off]</code>, the
     * next one into <code>b[off+1]</code>, and so on. The number of bytes read
     * is, at most, equal to <code>len</code>. Let <i>k</i> be the number of
     * bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements
     * <code>b[off]</code> through <code>b[off+</code><i>k</i><code>-1]</code>,
     * leaving elements <code>b[off+</code><i>k</i><code>]</code> through
     * <code>b[off+len-1]</code> unaffected.
     *
     * <p> In every case, elements <code>b[0]</code> through
     * <code>b[off]</code> and elements <code>b[off+len]</code> through
     * <code>b[b.length-1]</code> are unaffected.
     *
     * @param      b     the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @param off the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param      len   the maximum number of bytes read.
     * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *             <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end
     *             of the stream has been reached.
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
     * <code>b.length - off</code>
     * @exception  IOException if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
     * other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
     * input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
     * error occurs.
