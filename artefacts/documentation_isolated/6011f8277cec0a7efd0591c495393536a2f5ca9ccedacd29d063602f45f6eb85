     * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the specified number of seconds subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one second will
     * always be a duration of one second earlier.
     * This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one second.
     * Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param seconds  the seconds to subtract, may be negative
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the seconds subtracted, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
