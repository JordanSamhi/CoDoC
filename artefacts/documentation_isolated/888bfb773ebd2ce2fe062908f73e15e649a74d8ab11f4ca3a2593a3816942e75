     * Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and
     * stores them into the buffer array <code>b</code>. The number of
     * bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks
     * until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an
     * exception is thrown.
     *
     * <p>If <code>b</code> is null, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is
     * thrown. If the length of <code>b</code> is zero, then no bytes are
     * read and <code>0</code> is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt
     * to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the
     * stream is at end of file, the value <code>-1</code> is returned;
     * otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into <code>b</code>.
     *
     * <p>The first byte read is stored into element <code>b[0]</code>, the
     * next one into <code>b[1]</code>, and so on. The number of bytes read
     * is, at most, equal to the length of <code>b</code>. Let <code>k</code>
     * be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in
     * elements <code>b[0]</code> through <code>b[k-1]</code>, leaving
     * elements <code>b[k]</code> through <code>b[b.length-1]</code>
     * unaffected.
     *
     * <p>The <code>read(b)</code> method has the same effect as:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * read(b, 0, b.length)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @param      b   the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *             <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end
     *             of the stream has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException if the first byte cannot be read for any reason
     * other than end of file, the stream has been closed and the underlying
     * input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O
     * error occurs.
