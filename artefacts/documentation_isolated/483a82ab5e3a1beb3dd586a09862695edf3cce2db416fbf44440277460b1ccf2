     * Creates a string representation of this <tt>Date</tt> object in an
     * implementation-dependent form. The intent is that the form should
     * be familiar to the user of the Java application, wherever it may
     * happen to be running. The intent is comparable to that of the
     * "<code>%c</code>" format supported by the <code>strftime()</code>
     * function of ISO&nbsp;C.
     *
     * @return  a string representation of this date, using the locale
     *          conventions.
     * @see     java.text.DateFormat
     * @see     java.util.Date#toString()
     * @see     java.util.Date#toGMTString()
     * @deprecated As of JDK version 1.1,
     * replaced by <code>DateFormat.format(Date date)</code>.
