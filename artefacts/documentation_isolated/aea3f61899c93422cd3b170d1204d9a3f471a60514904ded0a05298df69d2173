     * Returns a {@code Long} instance representing the specified
     * {@code long} value.
     * If a new {@code Long} instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Long(long)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance by caching
     * frequently requested values.
     *
     * Note that unlike the {@linkplain Integer#valueOf(int)
     * corresponding method} in the {@code Integer} class, this method
     * is <em>not</em> required to cache values within a particular
     * range.
     *
     * @param  l a long value.
     * @return a {@code Long} instance representing {@code l}.
