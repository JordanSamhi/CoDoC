     * Sets the limits of this matcher's region. The region is the part of the
     * input sequence that will be searched to find a match. Invoking this
     * method resets the matcher, and then sets the region to start at the
     * index specified by the <code>start</code> parameter and end at the
     * index specified by the <code>end</code> parameter.
     *
     * <p>Depending on the transparency and anchoring being used (see
     * {@link #useTransparentBounds useTransparentBounds} and
     * {@link #useAnchoringBounds useAnchoringBounds}), certain constructs such
     * as anchors may behave differently at or around the boundaries of the
     * region.

     * @param  start
     *         The index to start searching at (inclusive)
     * @param  end
     *         The index to end searching at (exclusive)
     * @throws  IndexOutOfBoundsException
     *          If start or end is less than zero, if
     *          start is greater than the length of the input sequence, if

     *          start is greater than end.
