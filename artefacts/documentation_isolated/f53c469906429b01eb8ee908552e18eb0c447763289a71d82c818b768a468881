     * Gets the value of the specified environment variable. An
     * environment variable is a system-dependent external named
     * value.
     *
     * <p>If a security manager exists, its
     * {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission}
     * method is called with a
     * <code>{@link RuntimePermission}("getenv."+name)</code>
     * permission.  This may result in a {@link SecurityException}
     * being thrown.  If no exception is thrown the value of the
     * variable <code>name</code> is returned.
     *
     * <p><a name="EnvironmentVSSystemProperties"><i>System
     * properties</i> and <i>environment variables</i></a> are both
     * conceptually mappings between names and values.  Both
     * mechanisms can be used to pass user-defined information to a
     * Java process.  Environment variables have a more global effect,
     * because they are visible to all descendants of the process
     * which defines them, not just the immediate Java subprocess.
     * They can have subtly different semantics, such as case
     * insensitivity, on different operating systems.  For these
     * reasons, environment variables are more likely to have
     * unintended side effects.  It is best to use system properties
     * where possible.  Environment variables should be used when a
     * global effect is desired, or when an external system interface
     * requires an environment variable (such as <code>PATH</code>).
     *
     * <p>On UNIX systems the alphabetic case of <code>name</code> is
     * typically significant, while on Microsoft Windows systems it is
     * typically not.  For example, the expression
     * <code>System.getenv("FOO").equals(System.getenv("foo"))</code>
     * is likely to be true on Microsoft Windows.
     *
     * @param  name the name of the environment variable
     * @return the string value of the variable, or <code>null</code>
     *         if the variable is not defined in the system environment
     * @throws NullPointerException if <code>name</code> is <code>null</code>
     * @throws SecurityException
