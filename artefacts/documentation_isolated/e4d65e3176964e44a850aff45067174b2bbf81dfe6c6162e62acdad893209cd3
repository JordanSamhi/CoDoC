     * Determines the date and time based on the arguments. The
     * arguments are interpreted as a year, month, day of the month,
     * hour of the day, minute within the hour, and second within the
     * minute, exactly as for the <tt>Date</tt> constructor with six
     * arguments, except that the arguments are interpreted relative
     * to UTC rather than to the local time zone. The time indicated is
     * returned represented as the distance, measured in milliseconds,
     * of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1, 1970).
     *
     * @param   year    the year minus 1900.

     * @param   min     the minutes between 0-59.
     * @param   sec     the seconds between 0-59.
     * @return  the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT for
     *          the date and time specified by the arguments.
     * @see     java.util.Calendar
     * @deprecated As of JDK version 1.1,
     * replaced by <code>Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date,
     * hrs, min, sec)</code> or <code>GregorianCalendar(year + 1900,
     * month, date, hrs, min, sec)</code>, using a UTC
     * <code>TimeZone</code>, followed by <code>Calendar.getTime().getTime()</code>.
