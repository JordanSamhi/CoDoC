     * Returns a copy of this date with the specified amount added.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDate}, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
     * The amount is typically {@link Period} but may be any other type implementing
     * the {@link TemporalAmount} interface.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
     * {@link TemporalAmount#addTo(Temporal)}. The amount implementation is free
     * to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
     * calls back to {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)}. Consult the documentation
     * of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param amountToAdd  the amount to add, not null
     * @return a {@code LocalDate} based on this date with the addition made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
