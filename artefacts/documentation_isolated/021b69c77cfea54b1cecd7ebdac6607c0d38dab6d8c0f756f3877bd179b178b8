     * Otherwise, the priority of this ThreadGroup object is set to the
     * smaller of the specified <code>pri</code> and the maximum permitted
     * priority of the parent of this thread group. (If this thread group
     * is the system thread group, which has no parent, then its maximum
     * priority is simply set to <code>pri</code>.) Then this method is
     * called recursively, with <code>pri</code> as its argument, for
     * every thread group that belongs to this thread group.
