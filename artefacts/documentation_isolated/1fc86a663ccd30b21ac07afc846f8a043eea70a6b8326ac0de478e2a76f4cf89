     * Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available
     * within the given waiting time and the current thread has not
     * been {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
     * with the value {@code true},
     * reducing the number of available permits by one.
     *
     * <p>If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
     * disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
     * one of three things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@link #release} method for this
     * semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If a permit is acquired then the value {@code true} is returned.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * to acquire a permit,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then the value {@code false}
     * is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
     * will not wait at all.
     *
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait for a permit
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code timeout} argument
     * @return {@code true} if a permit was acquired and {@code false}
     *         if the waiting time elapsed before a permit was acquired
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
