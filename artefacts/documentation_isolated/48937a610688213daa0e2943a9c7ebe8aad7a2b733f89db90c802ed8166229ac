     * Skips over and discards <code>n</code> bytes of data from the
     * input stream. The <code>skip</code> method may, for a variety of
     * reasons, end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes,
     * possibly <code>0</code>. The actual number of bytes skipped is
     * returned.
     * <p>
     * This method simply performs <code>in.skip(n)</code>.
     *
     * @param      n   the number of bytes to be skipped.
     * @return     the actual number of bytes skipped.
     * @exception  IOException  if the stream does not support seek,
     *                          or if some other I/O error occurs.
