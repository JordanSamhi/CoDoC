     * This will query the {@link Clock#system(ZoneId) system clock} to obtain the current month-day.
     * Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
     * <p>
     * Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
     * because the clock is hard-coded.

     * @param zone  the zone ID to use, not null
