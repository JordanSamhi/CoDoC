     * Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified list.  This method allows
     * modules to provide users with "read-only" access to internal
     * lists.  Query operations on the returned list "read through" to the
     * specified list, and attempts to modify the returned list, whether
     * direct or via its iterator, result in an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.<p>
     *
     * The returned list will be serializable if the specified list
     * is serializable. Similarly, the returned list will implement
     * {@link RandomAccess} if the specified list does.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the list
     * @param  list the list for which an unmodifiable view is to be returned.
     * @return an unmodifiable view of the specified list.
