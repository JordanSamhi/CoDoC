     * Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
     * retaining the instant.
     * <p>
     * This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
     * This normally results in a change to the local date-time.
     * <p>
     * This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
     * in the local time-line have no effect on the result.
     * <p>
     * To change the offset while keeping the local time,
     * use {@link #withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)}.
     *
     * @param zone  the time-zone to change to, not null
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
