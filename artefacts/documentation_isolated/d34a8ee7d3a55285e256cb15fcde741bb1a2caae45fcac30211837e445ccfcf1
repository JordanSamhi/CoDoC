     * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
     *
     * <p>The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all double
     * values: {@code -0.0d == 0.0d} is {@code true} and a {@code Double.NaN}
     * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
     * even itself. This method uses the total order imposed by the method
     * {@link Double#compareTo}: {@code -0.0d} is treated as less than value
     * {@code 0.0d} and {@code Double.NaN} is considered greater than any
     * other value and all {@code Double.NaN} values are considered equal.
     *
     * @implNote The sorting algorithm is a parallel sort-merge that breaks the
     * array into sub-arrays that are themselves sorted and then merged. When
     * the sub-array length reaches a minimum granularity, the sub-array is
     * sorted using the appropriate {@link Arrays#sort(double[]) Arrays.sort}
     * method. If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum
     * granularity, then it is sorted using the appropriate {@link
     * Arrays#sort(double[]) Arrays.sort} method. The algorithm requires a
     * working space no greater than the size of the original array. The
     * {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() ForkJoin common pool} is used to
     * execute any parallel tasks.
