     * Sets the owner's or everybody's write permission for this abstract
     * pathname.
     *
     * <p> The {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines methods that operate on
     * file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
     * manipulation of file permissions is required.
     *
     * @param   writable
     *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow write
     *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow write operations
     *
     * @param   ownerOnly
     *          If <code>true</code>, the write permission applies only to the
     *          owner's write permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.  If
     *          the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's write
     *          permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
     *          everybody, regardless of this value.
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded. The
     *          operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change
     *          the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the named file
     *
