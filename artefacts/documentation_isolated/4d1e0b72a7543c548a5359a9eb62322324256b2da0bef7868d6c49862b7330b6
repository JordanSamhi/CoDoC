     * Converts the argument to a {@code long} by an unsigned
     * conversion.  In an unsigned conversion to a {@code long}, the
     * high-order 56 bits of the {@code long} are zero and the
     * low-order 8 bits are equal to the bits of the {@code byte} argument.
     *
     * Consequently, zero and positive {@code byte} values are mapped
     * to a numerically equal {@code long} value and negative {@code
     * byte} values are mapped to a {@code long} value equal to the
     * input plus 2<sup>8</sup>.
     *
     * @param  x the value to convert to an unsigned {@code long}
     * @return the argument converted to {@code long} by an unsigned
     *         conversion
