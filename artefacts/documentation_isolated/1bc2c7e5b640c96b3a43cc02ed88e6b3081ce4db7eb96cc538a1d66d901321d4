     * Implement this method to intercept all touch screen motion events.  This
     * allows you to watch events as they are dispatched to your children, and
     * take ownership of the current gesture at any point.
     *
     * <p>Using this function takes some care, as it has a fairly complicated
     * interaction with {@link View#onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)
     * View.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)}, and using it requires implementing
     * that method as well as this one in the correct way.  Events will be
     * received in the following order:
     *
     * <ol>
     * <li> You will receive the down event here.
     * <li> The down event will be handled either by a child of this view
     * group, or given to your own onTouchEvent() method to handle; this means
     * you should implement onTouchEvent() to return true, so you will
     * continue to see the rest of the gesture (instead of looking for
     * a parent view to handle it).  Also, by returning true from
     * onTouchEvent(), you will not receive any following
     * events in onInterceptTouchEvent() and all touch processing must
     * happen in onTouchEvent() like normal.
     * <li> For as long as you return false from this function, each following
     * event (up to and including the final up) will be delivered first here
     * and then to the target's onTouchEvent().
     * <li> If you return true from here, you will not receive any
     * following events: the target view will receive the same event but
     * with the action {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_CANCEL}, and all further
     * events will be delivered to your onTouchEvent() method and no longer
     * appear here.
     * </ol>
     *
     * @param ev The motion event being dispatched down the hierarchy.
     * @return Return true to steal motion events from the children and have
     * them dispatched to this ViewGroup through onTouchEvent().
     * The current target will receive an ACTION_CANCEL event, and no further
     * messages will be delivered here.
