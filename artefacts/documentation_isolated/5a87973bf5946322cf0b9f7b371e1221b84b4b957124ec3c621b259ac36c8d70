     * Opens a directory, returning a {@link DirectoryStream} to iterate over
     * all entries in the directory. The elements returned by the directory
     * stream's {@link DirectoryStream#iterator iterator} are of type {@code
     * Path}, each one representing an entry in the directory. The {@code Path}
     * objects are obtained as if by {@link Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the
     * name of the directory entry against {@code dir}.
     *
     * <p> When not using the try-with-resources construct, then directory
     * stream's {@code close} method should be invoked after iteration is
     * completed so as to free any resources held for the open directory.
     *
     * <p> When an implementation supports operations on entries in the
     * directory that execute in a race-free manner then the returned directory
     * stream is a {@link SecureDirectoryStream}.
     *
     * @param   dir
     *          the path to the directory
     *
     * @return  a new and open {@code DirectoryStream} object
     *
     * @throws  NotDirectoryException
     *          if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
     *          a directory <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the directory.
