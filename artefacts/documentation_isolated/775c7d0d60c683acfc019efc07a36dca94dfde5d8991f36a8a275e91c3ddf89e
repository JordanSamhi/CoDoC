     * Returns a string representation of the integer argument as an
     * unsigned integer in base&nbsp;8.
     *
     * <p>The unsigned integer value is the argument plus 2<sup>32</sup>
     * if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is equal to the
     * argument.  This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits
     * in octal (base&nbsp;8) with no extra leading {@code 0}s.
     *
     * <p>The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned
     * string {@code s} by calling {@link
     * Integer#parseUnsignedInt(String, int)
     * Integer.parseUnsignedInt(s, 8)}.
     *
     * <p>If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a
     * single zero character {@code '0'} ({@code '\u005Cu0030'});
     * otherwise, the first character of the representation of the
     * unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The
     * following characters are used as octal digits:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     * {@code 01234567}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * These are the characters {@code '\u005Cu0030'} through
     * {@code '\u005Cu0037'}.
     *
     * @param   i   an integer to be converted to a string.
     * @return  the string representation of the unsigned integer value
     *          represented by the argument in octal (base&nbsp;8).
