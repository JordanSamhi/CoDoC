     * Compares this {@code OffsetTime} to another time.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is based first on the UTC equivalent instant, then on the local time.
     * It is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     * <p>
     * For example, the following is the comparator order:
     * <ol>
     * <li>{@code 10:30+01:00}</li>
     * <li>{@code 11:00+01:00}</li>
     * <li>{@code 12:00+02:00}</li>
     * <li>{@code 11:30+01:00}</li>
     * <li>{@code 12:00+01:00}</li>
     * <li>{@code 12:30+01:00}</li>
     * </ol>
     * Values #2 and #3 represent the same instant on the time-line.
     * When two values represent the same instant, the local time is compared
     * to distinguish them. This step is needed to make the ordering
     * consistent with {@code equals()}.
     * <p>
     * To compare the underlying local time of two {@code TemporalAccessor} instances,
     * use {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_DAY} as a comparator.
     *
     * @param other  the other time to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code other} is null
