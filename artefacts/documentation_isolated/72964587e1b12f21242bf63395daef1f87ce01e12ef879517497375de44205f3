     * Inflate a new view hierarchy from the specified xml resource. Throws
     * {@link InflateException} if there is an error.
     *
     * @param resource ID for an XML layout resource to load (e.g.,
     *        <code>R.layout.main_page</code>)
     * @param root Optional view to be the parent of the generated hierarchy (if
     *        <em>attachToRoot</em> is true), or else simply an object that
     *        provides a set of LayoutParams values for root of the returned
     *        hierarchy (if <em>attachToRoot</em> is false.)
     * @param attachToRoot Whether the inflated hierarchy should be attached to
     *        the root parameter? If false, root is only used to create the
     *        correct subclass of LayoutParams for the root view in the XML.
     * @return The root View of the inflated hierarchy. If root was supplied and
     *         attachToRoot is true, this is root; otherwise it is the root of
     *         the inflated XML file.
