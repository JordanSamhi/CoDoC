     * Returns the greater of two {@code double} values.  That
     * is, the result is the argument closer to positive infinity. If
     * the arguments have the same value, the result is that same
     * value. If either value is NaN, then the result is NaN.  Unlike
     * the numerical comparison operators, this method considers
     * negative zero to be strictly smaller than positive zero. If one
     * argument is positive zero and the other negative zero, the
     * result is positive zero.
     *
     * @param   a   an argument.
     * @param   b   another argument.
     * @return  the larger of {@code a} and {@code b}.
