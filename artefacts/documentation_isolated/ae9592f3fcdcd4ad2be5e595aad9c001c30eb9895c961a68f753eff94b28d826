     * Converts the specified character (Unicode code point) to its
     * UTF-16 representation. If the specified code point is a BMP
     * (Basic Multilingual Plane or Plane 0) value, the same value is
     * stored in {@code dst[dstIndex]}, and 1 is returned. If the
     * specified code point is a supplementary character, its
     * surrogate values are stored in {@code dst[dstIndex]}
     * (high-surrogate) and {@code dst[dstIndex+1]}
     * (low-surrogate), and 2 is returned.
     *
     * @param  codePoint the character (Unicode code point) to be converted.
     * @param  dst an array of {@code char} in which the
     * {@code codePoint}'s UTF-16 value is stored.
     * @param dstIndex the start index into the {@code dst}
     * array where the converted value is stored.
     * @return 1 if the code point is a BMP code point, 2 if the
     * code point is a supplementary code point.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the specified
     * {@code codePoint} is not a valid Unicode code point.
     * @exception NullPointerException if the specified {@code dst} is null.
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if {@code dstIndex}
     * is negative or not less than {@code dst.length}, or if
     * {@code dst} at {@code dstIndex} doesn't have enough
     * array element(s) to store the resulting {@code char}
     * value(s). (If {@code dstIndex} is equal to
     * {@code dst.length-1} and the specified
     * {@code codePoint} is a supplementary character, the
     * high-surrogate value is not stored in
     * {@code dst[dstIndex]}.)
