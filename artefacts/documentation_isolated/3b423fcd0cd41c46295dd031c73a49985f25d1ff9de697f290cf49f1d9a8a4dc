     * Deletes a file if it exists. This method works in exactly the manner
     * specified by the {@link Files#deleteIfExists} method.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method simply invokes {@link
     * #delete} ignoring the {@code NoSuchFileException} when the file does not
     * exist. It may be overridden where appropriate.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to delete
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file was deleted by this method; {@code
     *          false} if the file could not be deleted because it did not
     *          exist
     *
     * @throws  DirectoryNotEmptyException
     *          if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
     *          because the directory is not empty <i>(optional specific
     *          exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkDelete(String)} method
     *          is invoked to check delete access to the file
