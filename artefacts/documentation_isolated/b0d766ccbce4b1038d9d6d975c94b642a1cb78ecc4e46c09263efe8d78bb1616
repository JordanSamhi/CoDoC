     * Gets a comparator that compares {@code ChronoLocalDate} in
     * time-line order ignoring the chronology.
     * <p>
     * This comparator differs from the comparison in {@link #compareTo} in that it
     * only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
     * This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
     * on the position of the date on the local time-line.
     * The underlying comparison is equivalent to comparing the epoch-day.
