     * Checks if this clock is equal to another clock.
     * <p>
     * Clocks should override this method to compare equals based on
     * their state and to meet the contract of {@link Object#equals}.
     * If not overridden, the behavior is defined by {@link Object#equals}
     *
     * @param obj  the object to check, null returns false
     * @return true if this is equal to the other clock
