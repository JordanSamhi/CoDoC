     * Returns a string representation of this stack trace element.  The
     * format of this string depends on the implementation, but the following
     * examples may be regarded as typical:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     *   {@code "MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)"} - Here, {@code "MyClass"}
     *   is the <i>fully-qualified name</i> of the class containing the
     *   execution point represented by this stack trace element,
     *   {@code "mash"} is the name of the method containing the execution
     *   point, {@code "MyClass.java"} is the source file containing the
     *   execution point, and {@code "9"} is the line number of the source
     *   line containing the execution point.
     * <li>
     *   {@code "MyClass.mash(MyClass.java)"} - As above, but the line
     *   number is unavailable.
     * <li>
     *   {@code "MyClass.mash(Unknown Source)"} - As above, but neither
     *   the file name nor the line  number are available.
     * <li>
     *   {@code "MyClass.mash(Native Method)"} - As above, but neither
     *   the file name nor the line  number are available, and the method
     *   containing the execution point is known to be a native method.
     * </ul>
