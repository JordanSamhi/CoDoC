     * Returns an array containing {@code Constructor} objects reflecting
     * all the public constructors of the class represented by this
     * {@code Class} object.  An array of length 0 is returned if the
     * class has no public constructors, or if the class is an array class, or
     * if the class reflects a primitive type or void.
     *
     * Note that while this method returns an array of {@code
     * Constructor<T>} objects (that is an array of constructors from
     * this class), the return type of this method is {@code
     * Constructor<?>[]} and <em>not</em> {@code Constructor<T>[]} as
     * might be expected.  This less informative return type is
     * necessary since after being returned from this method, the
     * array could be modified to hold {@code Constructor} objects for
     * different classes, which would violate the type guarantees of
     * {@code Constructor<T>[]}.
     *
     * @return the array of {@code Constructor} objects representing the

     * @throws SecurityException
     *         If a security manager, <i>s</i>, is present and
     *         the caller's class loader is not the same as or an
     *         ancestor of the class loader for the current class and
     *         invocation of {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     *         s.checkPackageAccess()} denies access to the package
     *         of this class.
