     * Calculates the period between this date and another date as a {@code Period}.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the period between two dates in terms of years, months and days.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is performed using the ISO calendar system.
     * If necessary, the input date will be converted to ISO.
     * <p>
     * The start date is included, but the end date is not.
     * The period is calculated by removing complete months, then calculating
     * the remaining number of days, adjusting to ensure that both have the same sign.
     * The number of months is then normalized into years and months based on a 12 month year.
     * A month is considered to be complete if the end day-of-month is greater
     * than or equal to the start day-of-month.
     * For example, from {@code 2010-01-15} to {@code 2011-03-18} is "1 year, 2 months and 3 days".
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link Period#between(LocalDate, LocalDate)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   period = start.until(end);
     *   period = Period.between(start, end);
     * </pre>
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     *
     * @param endDateExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
     * @return the period between this date and the end date, not null
