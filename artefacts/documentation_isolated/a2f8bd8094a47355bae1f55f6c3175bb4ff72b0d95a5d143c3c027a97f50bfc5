     * Determines if the specified character is a Unicode space character.
     * A character is considered to be a space character if and only if
     * it is specified to be a space character by the Unicode Standard. This
     * method returns true if the character's general category type is any of
     * the following:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@code SPACE_SEPARATOR}
     * <li> {@code LINE_SEPARATOR}
     * <li> {@code PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR}
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a
     * href="#supplementary"> supplementary characters</a>. To support
     * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
     * the {@link #isSpaceChar(int)} method.
     *
     * @param   ch      the character to be tested.
     * @return  {@code true} if the character is a space character;
     *          {@code false} otherwise.
