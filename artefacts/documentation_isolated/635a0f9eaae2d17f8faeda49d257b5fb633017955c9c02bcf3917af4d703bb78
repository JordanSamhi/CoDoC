     * Writes a string to the underlying output stream using
     * <a href="DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
     * encoding in a machine-independent manner.
     * <p>
     * First, two bytes are written to the output stream as if by the
     * <code>writeShort</code> method giving the number of bytes to
     * follow. This value is the number of bytes actually written out,
     * not the length of the string. Following the length, each character
     * of the string is output, in sequence, using the modified UTF-8 encoding
     * for the character. If no exception is thrown, the counter
     * <code>written</code> is incremented by the total number of
     * bytes written to the output stream. This will be at least two
     * plus the length of <code>str</code>, and at most two plus
     * thrice the length of <code>str</code>.
     *
     * @param      str   a string to be written.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
