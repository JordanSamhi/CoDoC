     * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit subtracted. If it is not possible to subtract the amount,
     * because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * The calculation for date and time units differ.
     * <p>
     * Date units operate on the local time-line.
     * The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back
     * to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
     * The conversion uses {@link #ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}
     * with the offset before the subtraction.
     * <p>
     * Time units operate on the instant time-line.
     * The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back to
     * a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
     * The conversion uses {@link #ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)}
     * with the offset before the subtraction.
     * <p>
     * This method is equivalent to {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)} with the amount negated.
     * See that method for a full description of how addition, and thus subtraction, works.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
