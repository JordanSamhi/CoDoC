     * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
     *
     * <p>The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all float
     * values: {@code -0.0f == 0.0f} is {@code true} and a {@code Float.NaN}
     * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
     * even itself. This method uses the total order imposed by the method
     * {@link Float#compareTo}: {@code -0.0f} is treated as less than value
     * {@code 0.0f} and {@code Float.NaN} is considered greater than any
     * other value and all {@code Float.NaN} values are considered equal.
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort
     * by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch. This algorithm
     * offers O(n log(n)) performance on many data sets that cause other
     * quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance, and is typically
     * faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
