     * Opens or creates a file for reading and/or writing, returning a file
     * channel to access the file. This method works in exactly the manner
     * specified by the {@link FileChannel#open(Path,Set,FileAttribute[])
     * FileChannel.open} method. A provider that does not support all the
     * features required to construct a file channel throws {@code
     * UnsupportedOperationException}. The default provider is required to
     * support the creation of file channels. When not overridden, the default
     * implementation throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path of the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the file
     *
     * @return  a new file channel
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          If the set contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          If this provider that does not support creating file channels,
     *          or an unsupported open option or file attribute is specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default file system, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          read access if the file is opened for reading. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)} method is invoked to check
     *          write access if the file is opened for writing
