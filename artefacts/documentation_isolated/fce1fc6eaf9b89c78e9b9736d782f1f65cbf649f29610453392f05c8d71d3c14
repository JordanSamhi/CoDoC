     * Parses the string argument as an unsigned decimal integer. The
     * characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except
     * that the first character may be an an ASCII plus sign {@code
     * '+'} ({@code '\u005Cu002B'}). The resulting integer value
     * is returned, exactly as if the argument and the radix 10 were
     * given as arguments to the {@link
     * #parseUnsignedInt(java.lang.String, int)} method.
     *
     * @param s   a {@code String} containing the unsigned {@code int}
     *            representation to be parsed
     * @return    the unsigned integer value represented by the argument in decimal.
     * @throws    NumberFormatException  if the string does not contain a
     *            parsable unsigned integer.
