     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZoneId} from an ID ensuring that the
     * ID is valid and available for use.
     * <p>
     * This method parses the ID producing a {@code ZoneId} or {@code ZoneOffset}.
     * A {@code ZoneOffset} is returned if the ID is 'Z', or starts with '+' or '-'.
     * The result will always be a valid ID for which {@link ZoneRules} can be obtained.
     * <p>
     * Parsing matches the zone ID step by step as follows.
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the zone ID equals 'Z', the result is {@code ZoneOffset.UTC}.
     * <li>If the zone ID consists of a single letter, the zone ID is invalid
     *  and {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
     * <li>If the zone ID starts with '+' or '-', the ID is parsed as a
     *  {@code ZoneOffset} using {@link ZoneOffset#of(String)}.
     * <li>If the zone ID equals 'GMT', 'UTC' or 'UT' then the result is a {@code ZoneId}
     *  with the same ID and rules equivalent to {@code ZoneOffset.UTC}.
     * <li>If the zone ID starts with 'UTC+', 'UTC-', 'GMT+', 'GMT-', 'UT+' or 'UT-'
     *  then the ID is a prefixed offset-based ID. The ID is split in two, with
     *  a two or three letter prefix and a suffix starting with the sign.
     *  The suffix is parsed as a {@link ZoneOffset#of(String) ZoneOffset}.
     *  The result will be a {@code ZoneId} with the specified UTC/GMT/UT prefix
     *  and the normalized offset ID as per {@link ZoneOffset#getId()}.
     *  The rules of the returned {@code ZoneId} will be equivalent to the
     *  parsed {@code ZoneOffset}.
     * <li>All other IDs are parsed as region-based zone IDs. Region IDs must
     *  match the regular expression <code>[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9~/._+-]+</code>
     *  otherwise a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown. If the zone ID is not
     *  in the configured set of IDs, {@code ZoneRulesException} is thrown.
     *  The detailed format of the region ID depends on the group supplying the data.
     *  The default set of data is supplied by the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).
     *  This has region IDs of the form '{area}/{city}', such as 'Europe/Paris' or 'America/New_York'.
     *  This is compatible with most IDs from {@link java.util.TimeZone}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param zoneId  the time-zone ID, not null
     * @return the zone ID, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the zone ID has an invalid format
     * @throws ZoneRulesException if the zone ID is a region ID that cannot be found
