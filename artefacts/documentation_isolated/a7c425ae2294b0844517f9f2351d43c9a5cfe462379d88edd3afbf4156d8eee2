     * Returns an empty set (immutable).  This set is serializable.
     * Unlike the like-named field, this method is parameterized.
     *
     * <p>This example illustrates the type-safe way to obtain an empty set:
     * <pre>
     *     Set&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.emptySet();
     * </pre>
     * @implNote Implementations of this method need not create a separate
     * {@code Set} object for each call.  Using this method is likely to have
     * comparable cost to using the like-named field.  (Unlike this method, the
     * field does not provide type safety.)
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the set
     * @return the empty set
