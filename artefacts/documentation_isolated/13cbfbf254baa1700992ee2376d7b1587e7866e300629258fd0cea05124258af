     * Returns a hash code based on the contents of the specified array.  If
     * the array contains other arrays as elements, the hash code is based on
     * their identities rather than their contents.  It is therefore
     * acceptable to invoke this method on an array that contains itself as an
     * element,  either directly or indirectly through one or more levels of
     * arrays.
     *
     * <p>For any two arrays <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> such that
     * <tt>Arrays.equals(a, b)</tt>, it is also the case that
     * <tt>Arrays.hashCode(a) == Arrays.hashCode(b)</tt>.
     *
     * <p>The value returned by this method is equal to the value that would
     * be returned by <tt>Arrays.asList(a).hashCode()</tt>, unless <tt>a</tt>
     * is <tt>null</tt>, in which case <tt>0</tt> is returned.
