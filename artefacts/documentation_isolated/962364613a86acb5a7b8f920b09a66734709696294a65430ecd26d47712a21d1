     * Determines the IP address of a host, given the host's name.
     *
     * <p> The host name can either be a machine name, such as
     * "{@code java.sun.com}", or a textual representation of its
     * IP address. If a literal IP address is supplied, only the
     * validity of the address format is checked.
     *
     * <p> For {@code host} specified in literal IPv6 address,
     * either the form defined in RFC 2732 or the literal IPv6 address
     * format defined in RFC 2373 is accepted. IPv6 scoped addresses are also
     * supported. See <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a> for a description of IPv6
     * scoped addresses.
     *
     * <p> If the host is {@code null} then an {@code InetAddress}
     * representing an address of the loopback interface is returned.
     * See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt">RFC&nbsp;3330</a>
     * section&nbsp;2 and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt">RFC&nbsp;2373</a>
     * section&nbsp;2.5.3. </p>

     * @param      host   the specified host, or {@code null}.
     * @return     an IP address for the given host name.
     * @exception  UnknownHostException  if no IP address for the
     *               {@code host} could be found, or if a scope_id was specified
     *               for a global IPv6 address.
     * @exception  SecurityException if a security manager exists
     *             and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation
