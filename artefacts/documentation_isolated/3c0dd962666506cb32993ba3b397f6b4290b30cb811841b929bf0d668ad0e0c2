     * Releases the given number of permits, returning them to the semaphore.
     *
     * <p>Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of
     * available permits by that amount.
     * If any threads are trying to acquire permits, then one thread
     * is selected and given the permits that were just released.
     * If the number of available permits satisfies that thread's request
     * then that thread is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes;
     * otherwise the thread will wait until sufficient permits are available.
     * If there are still permits available
     * after this thread's request has been satisfied, then those permits
     * are assigned in turn to other threads trying to acquire permits.
     *
     * <p>There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
     * have acquired that permit by calling {@link Semaphore#acquire acquire}.
     * Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
     * in the application.
     *
     * @param permits the number of permits to release
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code permits} is negative
