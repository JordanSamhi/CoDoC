     * Creates a single-threaded executor that can schedule commands
     * to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
     * (Note however that if this single
     * thread terminates due to a failure during execution prior to
     * shutdown, a new one will take its place if needed to execute
     * subsequent tasks.)  Tasks are guaranteed to execute
     * sequentially, and no more than one task will be active at any
     * given time. Unlike the otherwise equivalent
     * {@code newScheduledThreadPool(1)} the returned executor is
     * guaranteed not to be reconfigurable to use additional threads.
     * @return the newly created scheduled executor
