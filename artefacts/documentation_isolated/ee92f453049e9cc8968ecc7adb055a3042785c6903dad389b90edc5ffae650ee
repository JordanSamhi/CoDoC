     * <strong>Denigrated</strong>, use
     * {@linkplain #addIssuer(X500Principal)} or
     * {@linkplain #addIssuerName(byte[])} instead. This method should not be
     * relied on as it can fail to match some CRLs because of a loss of
     * encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished
     * names.
     * <p>
     * Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished
     * name in the {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
     * distinguished names.
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names
     * which {@code X509CRLs} may contain. The specified name is added to
     * any previous value for the issuerNames criterion.
     * If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
     *
     * @param name the name in RFC 2253 form
     * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
