     * Returns a copy of this period with the years and months normalized.
     * <p>
     * This normalizes the years and months units, leaving the days unit unchanged.
     * The months unit is adjusted to have an absolute value less than 11,
     * with the years unit being adjusted to compensate. For example, a period of
     * "1 Year and 15 months" will be normalized to "2 years and 3 months".
     * <p>
     * The sign of the years and months units will be the same after normalization.
     * For example, a period of "1 year and -25 months" will be normalized to
     * "-1 year and -1 month".
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @return a {@code Period} based on this period with excess months normalized to years, not null
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
