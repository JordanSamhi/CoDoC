     * Produces a method handle which will throw exceptions of the given {@code exType}.
     * The method handle will accept a single argument of {@code exType},
     * and immediately throw it as an exception.
     * The method type will nominally specify a return of {@code returnType}.
     * The return type may be anything convenient:  It doesn't matter to the
     * method handle's behavior, since it will never return normally.
     * @param returnType the return type of the desired method handle
     * @param exType the parameter type of the desired method handle
     * @return method handle which can throw the given exceptions
     * @throws NullPointerException if either argument is null
