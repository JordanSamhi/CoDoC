     * Returns the name constraints parameter. The specified name constraints
     * are associated with this trust anchor and are intended to be used
     * as additional constraints when validating an X.509 certification path.
     * <p>
     * The name constraints are returned as a byte array. This byte array
     * contains the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
     * would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 3280
     * and X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
     * documentation for
     * {@link #TrustAnchor(X509Certificate, byte[])
     * TrustAnchor(X509Certificate trustedCert, byte[] nameConstraints) }.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
     *
     * @return a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
     *         a NameConstraints extension used for checking name constraints,
     *         or {@code null} if not set.
