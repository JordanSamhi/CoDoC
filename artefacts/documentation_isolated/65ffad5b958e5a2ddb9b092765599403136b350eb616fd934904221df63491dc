     * Checks if all values in the range fit in an {@code int}.
     * <p>
     * This checks that all valid values are within the bounds of an {@code int}.
     * <p>
     * For example, the ISO month-of-year has values from 1 to 12, which fits in an {@code int}.
     * By comparison, ISO nano-of-day runs from 1 to 86,400,000,000,000 which does not fit in an {@code int}.
     * <p>
     * This implementation uses {@link #getMinimum()} and {@link #getMaximum()}.
     *
     * @return true if a valid value always fits in an {@code int}
