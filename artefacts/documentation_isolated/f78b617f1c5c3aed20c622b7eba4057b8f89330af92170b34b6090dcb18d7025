     * Reads a byte of data from this file. The byte is returned as an
     * integer in the range 0 to 255 ({@code 0x00-0x0ff}). This
     * method blocks if no input is yet available.
     * <p>
     * Although {@code RandomAccessFile} is not a subclass of
     * {@code InputStream}, this method behaves in exactly the same
     * way as the {@link InputStream#read()} method of
     * {@code InputStream}.
     *
     * @return     the next byte of data, or {@code -1} if the end of the
     *             file has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs. Not thrown if
     *                          end-of-file has been reached.
