     * Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
     * skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next
     * invocation of a method for this input stream. The next invocation might be
     * the same thread or another thread.  A single read or skip of this
     * many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the sum of the number of bytes remaining to be read in
     * the buffer (<code>count&nbsp;- pos</code>) and the result of calling the
     * {@link java.io.FilterInputStream#in in}.available().

     * @return     an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped

     * @exception  IOException  if this input stream has been closed by
