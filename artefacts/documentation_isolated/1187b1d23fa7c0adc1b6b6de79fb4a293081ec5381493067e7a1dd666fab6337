     * Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
     * The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
     * Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
     * <p>
     * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
     * A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
     * A selection of common adjustments is provided in
     * {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
     * These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
     * Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
     * such as {@link Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
     * The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
     * lengths of month and leap years.
     * <p>
     * For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
     * <pre>
     *  import static java.time.Month.*;
     *  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
     *
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The classes {@link LocalDate} and {@link LocalTime} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
     * thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
     * <pre>
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * {@link ZoneOffset} also implements {@code TemporalAdjuster} however using it
     * as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a {@code ZonedDateTime} is
     * controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
     * make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
     * If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
     * to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
     * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
     * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param adjuster the adjuster to use, not null
