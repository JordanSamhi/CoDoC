     * Checks if this duration is zero length.
     * <p>
     * A {@code Duration} represents a directed distance between two points on
     * the time-line and can therefore be positive, zero or negative.
     * This method checks whether the length is zero.
     *
     * @return true if this duration has a total length equal to zero
