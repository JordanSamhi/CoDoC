     * Computes a hash code for this abstract pathname.  Because equality of
     * abstract pathnames is inherently system-dependent, so is the computation
     * of their hash codes.  On UNIX systems, the hash code of an abstract
     * pathname is equal to the exclusive <em>or</em> of the hash code
     * of its pathname string and the decimal value
     * <code>1234321</code>.  On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
     * code is equal to the exclusive <em>or</em> of the hash code of
     * its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
     * value <code>1234321</code>.  Locale is not taken into account on
     * lowercasing the pathname string.

     * @return  A hash code for this abstract pathname
