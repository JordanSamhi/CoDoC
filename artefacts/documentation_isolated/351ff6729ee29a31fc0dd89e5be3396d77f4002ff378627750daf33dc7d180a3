     * Gets the value of the specified field as an {@code int}.
     * <p>
     * This queries the date-time for the value of the specified field.
     * The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
     * If the date-time cannot return the value, because the field is unsupported or for
     * some other reason, an exception will be thrown.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in {@link ChronoField}.
     * If the field is supported and has an {@code int} range, then the value of
     * the field must be returned.
     * If unsupported, then an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
     * read-only method is invoked.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:
     * <pre>
     *  if (range(field).isIntValue()) {
     *    return range(field).checkValidIntValue(getLong(field), field);
     *  }
     *  throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Invalid field " + field + " + for get() method, use getLong() instead");
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param field  the field to get, not null
     * @return the value for the field, within the valid range of values
     * @throws DateTimeException if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
     *         the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported or
     *         the range of values exceeds an {@code int}
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
