     * Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
     * <p>
     * This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
     * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
     * A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
     * A selection of common adjustments is provided in
     * {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
     * These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
     * The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
     * lengths of month and leap years.
     * <p>
     * Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
     * <pre>
     *  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
     *  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
     *  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
     * </pre>
     *
     * @implSpec
     * <p>
     * Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
     * Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
     * This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:
     * <pre>
     *  return adjuster.adjustInto(this);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param adjuster  the adjuster to use, not null
     * @return an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to make the adjustment
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
