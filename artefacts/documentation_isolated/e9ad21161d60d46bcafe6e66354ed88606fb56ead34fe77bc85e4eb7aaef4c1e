     * {@inheritDoc}

     * @implSpec
     * This implementation returns a straightforward implementation of the
     * {@code ListIterator} interface that extends the implementation of the
     * {@code Iterator} interface returned by the {@code iterator()} method.
     * The {@code ListIterator} implementation relies on the backing list's
     * {@code get(int)}, {@code set(int, E)}, {@code add(int, E)}
     * and {@code remove(int)} methods.
     *
     * <p>Note that the list iterator returned by this implementation will
     * throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} in response to its
     * {@code remove}, {@code set} and {@code add} methods unless the
     * list's {@code remove(int)}, {@code set(int, E)}, and
     * {@code add(int, E)} methods are overridden.
     *
     * <p>This implementation can be made to throw runtime exceptions in the
     * face of concurrent modification, as described in the specification for
     * the (protected) {@link #modCount} field.
