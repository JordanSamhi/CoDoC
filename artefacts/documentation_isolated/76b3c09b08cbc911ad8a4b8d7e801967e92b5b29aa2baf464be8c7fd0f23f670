     * This does not affect the host locale.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager, its <code>checkPermission</code>
     * method is called with a <code>PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")</code>
     * permission before the default locale is changed.
     * <p>
     * The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
     * based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
     * methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
     * <p>
     * Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
     * of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
     * is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
     * within the same Java Virtual Machine.
     * <p>
     * By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
     * locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.
