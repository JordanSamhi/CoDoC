     * Compares this offset to another offset in descending order.
     * <p>
     * The offsets are compared in the order that they occur for the same time
     * of day around the world. Thus, an offset of {@code +10:00} comes before an
     * offset of {@code +09:00} and so on down to {@code -18:00}.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, postive if greater
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code other} is null
