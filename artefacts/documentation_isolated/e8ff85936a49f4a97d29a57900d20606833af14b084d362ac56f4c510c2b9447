     * Sets float values that will be animated between. A single
     * value implies that that value is the one being animated to. However, this is not typically
     * useful in a ValueAnimator object because there is no way for the object to determine the
     * starting value for the animation (unlike ObjectAnimator, which can derive that value
     * from the target object and property being animated). Therefore, there should typically
     * be two or more values.
     *
     * <p>If there are already multiple sets of values defined for this ValueAnimator via more
     * than one PropertyValuesHolder object, this method will set the values for the first
     * of those objects.</p>
     *
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
