     * Constructs a reader that decodes bytes from the given channel using the
     * given decoder.
     *
     * <p> The resulting stream will contain an internal input buffer of at
     * least <tt>minBufferCap</tt> bytes.  The stream's <tt>read</tt> methods
     * will, as needed, fill the buffer by reading bytes from the underlying
     * channel; if the channel is in non-blocking mode when bytes are to be
     * read then an {@link IllegalBlockingModeException} will be thrown.  The
     * resulting stream will not otherwise be buffered, and it will not support
     * the {@link Reader#mark mark} or {@link Reader#reset reset} methods.
     * Closing the stream will in turn cause the channel to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel from which bytes will be read
     *
     * @param  dec
     *         The charset decoder to be used
     *
     * @param  minBufferCap
     *         The minimum capacity of the internal byte buffer,
     *         or <tt>-1</tt> if an implementation-dependent
     *         default capacity is to be used
     *
     * @return  A new reader
