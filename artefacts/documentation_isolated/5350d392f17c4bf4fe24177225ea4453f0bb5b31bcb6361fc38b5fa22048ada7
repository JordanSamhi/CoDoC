         * Sets whether this WakeLock is reference counted.
         * <p>
         * Wake locks are reference counted by default.  If a wake lock is
         * reference counted, then each call to {@link #acquire()} must be
         * balanced by an equal number of calls to {@link #release()}.  If a wake
         * lock is not reference counted, then one call to {@link #release()} is
         * sufficient to undo the effect of all previous calls to {@link #acquire()}.
         * </p>
         *
         * @param value True to make the wake lock reference counted, false to
         * make the wake lock non-reference counted.
