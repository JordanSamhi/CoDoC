     * Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the CRLs read
     * from the given input stream {@code inStream}.
     *
     * <p>In order to take advantage of the specialized CRL format
     * supported by this certificate factory, each element in
     * the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
     * CRL class. For example, if this certificate
     * factory implements X.509 CRLs, the elements in the returned
     * collection can be typecast to the {@code X509CRL} class.
     *
     * <p>In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 CRLs,
     * {@code inStream} may contain a sequence of DER-encoded CRLs.
     * In addition, {@code inStream} may contain a PKCS#7 CRL
     * set. This is a PKCS#7 <i>SignedData</i> object, with the only
     * significant field being <i>crls</i>. In particular, the
     * signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
     * CRLs to be downloaded at once. If no CRLs are present,
     * an empty collection is returned.
     *
     * <p>Note that if the given input stream does not support
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int) mark} and
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#reset() reset}, this method will
     * consume the entire input stream.
     *
     * @param inStream the input stream with the CRLs.
     *
     * @return a (possibly empty) collection view of
     * java.security.cert.CRL objects initialized with the data from the input
     * stream.
     *
     * @exception CRLException on parsing errors.
