     * Gets the offset applicable at the specified local date-time in these rules.
     * <p>
     * The mapping from a local date-time to an offset is not straightforward.
     * There are three cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
     *  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
     * <li>Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
     *  due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
     *  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
     * <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
     *  due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
     *  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets.
     * This method returns that list of valid offsets, which is a list of size 0, 1 or 2.
     * In the case where there are two offsets, the earlier offset is returned at index 0
     * and the later offset at index 1.
     * <p>
     * There are various ways to handle the conversion from a {@code LocalDateTime}.
     * One technique, using this method, would be:
     * <pre>
     *  List&lt;ZoneOffset&gt; validOffsets = rules.getOffset(localDT);
     *  if (validOffsets.size() == 1) {
     *    // Normal case: only one valid offset
     *    zoneOffset = validOffsets.get(0);
     *  } else {
     *    // Gap or Overlap: determine what to do from transition (which will be non-null)
     *    ZoneOffsetTransition trans = rules.getTransition(localDT);
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * In theory, it is possible for there to be more than two valid offsets.
     * This would happen if clocks to be put back more than once in quick succession.
     * This has never happened in the history of time-zones and thus has no special handling.
     * However, if it were to happen, then the list would return more than 2 entries.
     *
     * @param localDateTime  the local date-time to query for valid offsets, not null, but null
     *  may be ignored if the rules have a single offset for all instants
     * @return the list of valid offsets, may be immutable, not null
