     * @deprecated This method was originally designed to force a thread to stop
     *        and throw a given {@code Throwable} as an exception. It was
     *        inherently unsafe (see {@link #stop()} for details), and furthermore
     *        could be used to generate exceptions that the target thread was
     *        not prepared to handle.

     *        are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?</a>.
