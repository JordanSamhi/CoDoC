     * Obtains a clock that always returns the same instant.
     * <p>
     * This clock simply returns the specified instant.
     * As such, it is not a clock in the conventional sense.
     * The main use case for this is in testing, where the fixed clock ensures
     * tests are not dependent on the current clock.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
     *
     * @param fixedInstant  the instant to use as the clock, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null
     * @return a clock that always returns the same instant, not null
