     * Creates a {@code Spliterator} using a given {@code Iterator}
     * as the source of elements, with no initial size estimate.
     *
     * <p>The spliterator is not
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>, inherits
     * the <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the iterator, and implements
     * {@code trySplit} to permit limited parallelism.
     *
     * <p>Traversal of elements should be accomplished through the spliterator.
     * The behaviour of splitting and traversal is undefined if the iterator is
     * operated on after the spliterator is returned.
     *
     * @param <T> Type of elements
     * @param iterator The iterator for the source
     * @param characteristics Characteristics of this spliterator's source
     *        or elements ({@code SIZED} and {@code SUBSIZED}, if supplied, are
     *        ignored and are not reported.)
     * @return A spliterator from an iterator
     * @throws NullPointerException if the given iterator is {@code null}
