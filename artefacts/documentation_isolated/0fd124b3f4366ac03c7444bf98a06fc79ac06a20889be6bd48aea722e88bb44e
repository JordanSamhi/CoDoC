     * Loads the native library specified by the filename argument.  The filename
     * argument must be an absolute path name.
     * (for example
     * <code>Runtime.getRuntime().load("/home/avh/lib/libX11.so");</code>).
     *
     * If the filename argument, when stripped of any platform-specific library
     * prefix, path, and file extension, indicates a library whose name is,
     * for example, L, and a native library called L is statically linked
     * with the VM, then the JNI_OnLoad_L function exported by the library
     * is invoked rather than attempting to load a dynamic library.
     * A filename matching the argument does not have to exist in the file
     * system. See the JNI Specification for more details.
     *
     * Otherwise, the filename argument is mapped to a native library image in
     * an implementation-dependent manner.
     * <p>
     * First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkLink</code>
     * method is called with the <code>filename</code> as its argument.
     * This may result in a security exception.
     * <p>
     * This is similar to the method {@link #loadLibrary(String)}, but it
     * accepts a general file name as an argument rather than just a library
     * name, allowing any file of native code to be loaded.
     * <p>
     * The method {@link System#load(String)} is the conventional and
     * convenient means of invoking this method.
     *
     * @param      filename   the file to load.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             <code>checkLink</code> method doesn't allow
     *             loading of the specified dynamic library
     * @exception  UnsatisfiedLinkError  if either the filename is not an
     *             absolute path name, the native library is not statically
     *             linked with the VM, or the library cannot be mapped to
     *             a native library image by the host system.
