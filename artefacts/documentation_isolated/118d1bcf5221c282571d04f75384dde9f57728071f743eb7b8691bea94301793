     * Creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file <i>(optional
     * operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> The {@code link} parameter locates the directory entry to create.
     * The {@code existing} parameter is the path to an existing file. This
     * method creates a new directory entry for the file so that it can be
     * accessed using {@code link} as the path. On some file systems this is
     * known as creating a "hard link". Whether the file attributes are
     * maintained for the file or for each directory entry is file system
     * specific and therefore not specified. Typically, a file system requires
     * that all links (directory entries) for a file be on the same file system.
     * Furthermore, on some platforms, the Java virtual machine may require to
     * be started with implementation specific privileges to create hard links
     * or to create links to directories.
     *
     * @param   link
     *          the link (directory entry) to create
     * @param   existing
     *          a path to an existing file
     *
     * @return  the path to the link (directory entry)
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the implementation does not support adding an existing file
     *          to a directory
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if the entry could not otherwise be created because a file of
     *          that name already exists <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
     *          is installed, it denies {@link LinkPermission}<tt>("hard")</tt>
     *          or its {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method denies write access to either the link or the
     *          existing file.
