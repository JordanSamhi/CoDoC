     * Acquires in shared mode, ignoring interrupts.  Implemented by
     * first invoking at least once {@link #tryAcquireShared},
     * returning on success.  Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly
     * repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking {@link
     * #tryAcquireShared} until success.
     *
     * @param arg the acquire argument.  This value is conveyed to
     *        {@link #tryAcquireShared} but is otherwise uninterpreted
     *        and can represent anything you like.
