     * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDateTime}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit subtracted. If it is not possible to subtract the amount,
     * because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * This method is equivalent to {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)} with the amount negated.
     * See that method for a full description of how addition, and thus subtraction, works.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
