     * Appends the time-zone name, such as 'British Summer Time', to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This appends an instruction to format/parse the textual name of the zone to
     * the builder.
     * <p>
     * During formatting, the zone is obtained using a mechanism equivalent
     * to querying the temporal with {@link TemporalQueries#zoneId()}.
     * If the zone is a {@code ZoneOffset} it will be printed using the
     * result of {@link ZoneOffset#getId()}.
     * If the zone is not an offset, the textual name will be looked up
     * for the locale set in the {@link DateTimeFormatter}.
     * If the temporal object being printed represents an instant, then the text
     * will be the summer or winter time text as appropriate.
     * If the lookup for text does not find any suitable result, then the
     * {@link ZoneId#getId() ID} will be printed instead.
     * If the zone cannot be obtained then an exception is thrown unless the
     * section of the formatter is optional.
     * <p>
     * During parsing, either the textual zone name, the zone ID or the offset
     * is accepted. Many textual zone names are not unique, such as CST can be
     * for both "Central Standard Time" and "China Standard Time". In this
     * situation, the zone id will be determined by the region information from
     * formatter's  {@link DateTimeFormatter#getLocale() locale} and the standard
     * zone id for that area, for example, America/New_York for the America Eastern
     * zone. The {@link #appendZoneText(TextStyle, Set)} may be used
     * to specify a set of preferred {@link ZoneId} in this situation.
