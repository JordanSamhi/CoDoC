         * Produces a method handle for a reflected constructor.
         * The type of the method handle will be that of the constructor,
         * with the return type changed to the declaring class.
         * The method handle will perform a {@code newInstance} operation,
         * creating a new instance of the constructor's class on the
         * arguments passed to the method handle.
         * <p>
         * If the constructor's {@code accessible} flag is not set,
         * access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
         * <p>
         * The returned method handle will have
         * {@linkplain MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector variable arity} if and only if
         * the constructor's variable arity modifier bit ({@code 0x0080}) is set.
         * <p>
         * If the returned method handle is invoked, the constructor's class will
         * be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.
         * @param c the reflected constructor
         * @return a method handle which can invoke the reflected constructor
         * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails
         *                                or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
         *                                is set and {@code asVarargsCollector} fails
         * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null
