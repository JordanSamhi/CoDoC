     * Set the choices to be used in formatting.
     * @param limits contains the top value that you want
     * parsed with that format, and should be in ascending sorted order. When
     * formatting X, the choice will be the i, where
     * limit[i] &le; X {@literal <} limit[i+1].
     * If the limit array is not in ascending order, the results of formatting
     * will be incorrect.
     * @param formats are the formats you want to use for each limit.
     * They can be either Format objects or Strings.
     * When formatting with object Y,
     * if the object is a NumberFormat, then ((NumberFormat) Y).format(X)
     * is called. Otherwise Y.toString() is called.
