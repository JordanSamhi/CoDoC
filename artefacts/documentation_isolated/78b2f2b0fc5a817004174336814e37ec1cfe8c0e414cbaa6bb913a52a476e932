     * Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code int} value
     * between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from
     * this random number generator's sequence.  The general contract of
     * {@code nextInt} is that one {@code int} value in the specified range
     * is pseudorandomly generated and returned.  All {@code bound} possible
     * {@code int} values are produced with (approximately) equal
     * probability.  The method {@code nextInt(int bound)} is implemented by
     * class {@code Random} as if by:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * public int nextInt(int bound) {
     *   if (bound <= 0)
     *     throw new IllegalArgumentException("bound must be positive");
     *
     *   if ((bound & -bound) == bound)  // i.e., bound is a power of 2
     *     return (int)((bound * (long)next(31)) >> 31);
     *
     *   int bits, val;
     *   do {
     *       bits = next(31);
     *       val = bits % bound;
     *   } while (bits - val + (bound-1) < 0);
     *   return val;
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description only
     * because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of
     * independently chosen bits.  If it were a perfect source of randomly
     * chosen bits, then the algorithm shown would choose {@code int}
     * values from the stated range with perfect uniformity.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm is slightly tricky.  It rejects values that would result
     * in an uneven distribution (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible
     * by n). The probability of a value being rejected depends on n.  The
     * worst case is n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 1/2,
     * and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2.
     * <p>
     * The algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially: it
     * returns the correct number of high-order bits from the underlying
     * pseudo-random number generator.  In the absence of special treatment,
     * the correct number of <i>low-order</i> bits would be returned.  Linear
     * congruential pseudo-random number generators such as the one
     * implemented by this class are known to have short periods in the
     * sequence of values of their low-order bits.  Thus, this special case
     * greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned by
     * successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two.
     *
