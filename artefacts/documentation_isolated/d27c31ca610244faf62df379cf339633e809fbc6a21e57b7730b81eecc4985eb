     * Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
     * available.
     *
     * <p>Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
     * reducing the number of available permits by one.
     *
     * <p>If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
     * disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
     * some other thread invokes the {@link #release} method for this
     * semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}
     * while waiting for a permit then it will continue to wait, but the
     * time at which the thread is assigned a permit may change compared to
     * the time it would have received the permit had no interruption
     * occurred.  When the thread does return from this method its interrupt
     * status will be set.
