     * Converts the buffer's contents into a string decoding bytes using the
     * platform's default character set. The length of the new <tt>String</tt>
     * is a function of the character set, and hence may not be equal to the
     * size of the buffer.
     *
     * <p> This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
     * sequences with the default replacement string for the platform's
     * default character set. The {@linkplain java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder}
     * class should be used when more control over the decoding process is
     * required.
     *
     * @return String decoded from the buffer's contents.
