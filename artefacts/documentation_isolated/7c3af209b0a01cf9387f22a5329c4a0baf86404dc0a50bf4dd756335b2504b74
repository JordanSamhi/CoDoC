     * Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) navigable set backed by the
     * specified navigable set.  In order to guarantee serial access, it is
     * critical that <strong>all</strong> access to the backing navigable set is
     * accomplished through the returned navigable set (or its views).<p>
     *
     * It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned
     * navigable set when iterating over it or any of its {@code subSet},
     * {@code headSet}, or {@code tailSet} views.
     * <pre>
     *  NavigableSet s = Collections.synchronizedNavigableSet(new TreeSet());
     *      ...
     *  synchronized (s) {
     *      Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block
     *      while (i.hasNext())
     *          foo(i.next());
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * or:
     * <pre>
     *  NavigableSet s = Collections.synchronizedNavigableSet(new TreeSet());
     *  NavigableSet s2 = s.headSet(foo, true);
     *      ...
     *  synchronized (s) {  // Note: s, not s2!!!
     *      Iterator i = s2.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block
     *      while (i.hasNext())
     *          foo(i.next());
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.
     *
     * <p>The returned navigable set will be serializable if the specified
     * navigable set is serializable.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the set
