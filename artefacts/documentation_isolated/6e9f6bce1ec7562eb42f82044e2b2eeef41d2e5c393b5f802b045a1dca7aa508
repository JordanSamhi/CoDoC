     * This method is used to enable streaming of a HTTP request body
     * without internal buffering, when the content length is known in
     * advance.
     *
     * <P> An exception will be thrown if the application attempts to write
     * more data than the indicated content-length, or if the application
     * closes the OutputStream before writing the indicated amount.
     *
     * <P> When output streaming is enabled, authentication and redirection
     * cannot be handled automatically. A {@linkplain HttpRetryException} will
     * be thrown when reading the response if authentication or redirection
     * are required. This exception can be queried for the details of the
     * error.
     *
     * <P> This method must be called before the URLConnection is connected.
     *
     * <P> The content length set by invoking this method takes precedence
     * over any value set by {@link #setFixedLengthStreamingMode(int)}.
     *
     * @param  contentLength
     *         The number of bytes which will be written to the OutputStream.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException
     *          if URLConnection is already connected or if a different
     *          streaming mode is already enabled.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if a content length less than zero is specified.
