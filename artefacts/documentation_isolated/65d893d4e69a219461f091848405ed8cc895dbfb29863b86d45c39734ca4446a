     * Sets the seed of this random number generator using a single
     * {@code long} seed. The general contract of {@code setSeed} is
     * that it alters the state of this random number generator object
     * so as to be in exactly the same state as if it had just been
     * created with the argument {@code seed} as a seed. The method
     * {@code setSeed} is implemented by class {@code Random} by
     * atomically updating the seed to
     *  <pre>{@code (seed ^ 0x5DEECE66DL) & ((1L << 48) - 1)}</pre>
     * and clearing the {@code haveNextNextGaussian} flag used by {@link
     * #nextGaussian}.
     *
     * <p>The implementation of {@code setSeed} by class {@code Random}
     * happens to use only 48 bits of the given seed. In general, however,
     * an overriding method may use all 64 bits of the {@code long}
     * argument as a seed value.
     *
     * @param seed the initial seed
