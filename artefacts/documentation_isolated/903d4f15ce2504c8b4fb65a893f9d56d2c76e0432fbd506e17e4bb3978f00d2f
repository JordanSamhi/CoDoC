     * Converts the character argument to titlecase using case mapping
     * information from the UnicodeData file. If a character has no
     * explicit titlecase mapping and is not itself a titlecase char
     * according to UnicodeData, then the uppercase mapping is
     * returned as an equivalent titlecase mapping. If the
     * {@code char} argument is already a titlecase
     * {@code char}, the same {@code char} value will be
     * returned.
     * <p>
     * Note that
     * {@code Character.isTitleCase(Character.toTitleCase(ch))}
     * does not always return {@code true} for some ranges of
     * characters.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a

     * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
     * the {@link #toTitleCase(int)} method.
     *
     * @param   ch   the character to be converted.
     * @return  the titlecase equivalent of the character, if any;
     *          otherwise, the character itself.
