     * Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array.
     * The initial index of the range (<tt>from</tt>) must lie between zero
     * and <tt>original.length</tt>, inclusive.  The value at
     * <tt>original[from]</tt> is placed into the initial element of the copy
     * (unless <tt>from == original.length</tt> or <tt>from == to</tt>).
     * Values from subsequent elements in the original array are placed into
     * subsequent elements in the copy.  The final index of the range
     * (<tt>to</tt>), which must be greater than or equal to <tt>from</tt>,
     * may be greater than <tt>original.length</tt>, in which case
     * <tt>false</tt> is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is
     * greater than or equal to <tt>original.length - from</tt>.  The length
     * of the returned array will be <tt>to - from</tt>.
