     * Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified collection.  This method
     * allows modules to provide users with "read-only" access to internal
     * collections.  Query operations on the returned collection "read through"
     * to the specified collection, and attempts to modify the returned
     * collection, whether direct or via its iterator, result in an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.<p>
     *
     * The returned collection does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals
     * operations through to the backing collection, but relies on
     * <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  This
     * is necessary to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case
     * that the backing collection is a set or a list.<p>
     *
     * The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection
     * is serializable.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the collection
     * @param  c the collection for which an unmodifiable view is to be
     *         returned.
     * @return an unmodifiable view of the specified collection.
