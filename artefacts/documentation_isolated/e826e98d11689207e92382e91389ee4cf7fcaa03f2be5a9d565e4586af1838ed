     * Appends the specified exception to the exceptions that were
     * suppressed in order to deliver this exception. This method is
     * thread-safe and typically called (automatically and implicitly)
     * by the {@code try}-with-resources statement.
     *
     * <p>The suppression behavior is enabled <em>unless</em> disabled
     * {@linkplain #Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean) via
     * a constructor}.  When suppression is disabled, this method does
     * nothing other than to validate its argument.
     *
     * <p>Note that when one exception {@linkplain
     * #initCause(Throwable) causes} another exception, the first
     * exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
     * thrown in response.  In other words, there is a causal
     * connection between the two exceptions.
     *
     * In contrast, there are situations where two independent
     * exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
     * in the {@code try} block of a {@code try}-with-resources
     * statement and the compiler-generated {@code finally} block
     * which closes the resource.
     *
     * In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be
     * propagated.  In the {@code try}-with-resources statement, when
     * there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from
     * the {@code try} block is propagated and the exception from the
     * {@code finally} block is added to the list of exceptions
     * suppressed by the exception from the {@code try} block.  As an
     * exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
     * suppressed exceptions.
     *
     * <p>An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being
     * caused by another exception.  Whether or not an exception has a
     * cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike
     * whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions
     * which is typically only determined after an exception is
     * thrown.
     *
     * <p>Note that programmer written code is also able to take
     * advantage of calling this method in situations where there are
     * multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.
     *
     * @param exception the exception to be added to the list of
     *        suppressed exceptions
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code exception} is this
     *         throwable; a throwable cannot suppress itself.
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code exception} is {@code null}
