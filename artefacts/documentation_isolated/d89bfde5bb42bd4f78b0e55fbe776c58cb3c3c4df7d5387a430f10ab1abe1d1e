     * Returns a {@code Collector} implementing a "group by" operation on
     * input elements of type {@code T}, grouping elements according to a
     * classification function, and returning the results in a {@code Map}.
     *
     * <p>The classification function maps elements to some key type {@code K}.
     * The collector produces a {@code Map<K, List<T>>} whose keys are the
     * values resulting from applying the classification function to the input
     * elements, and whose corresponding values are {@code List}s containing the
     * input elements which map to the associated key under the classification
     * function.
     *
     * <p>There are no guarantees on the type, mutability, serializability, or
     * thread-safety of the {@code Map} or {@code List} objects returned.
     * @implSpec
     * This produces a result similar to:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     groupingBy(classifier, toList());
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @implNote
     * The returned {@code Collector} is not concurrent.  For parallel stream
     * pipelines, the {@code combiner} function operates by merging the keys
     * from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation.  If
     * preservation of the order in which elements appear in the resulting {@code Map}
     * collector is not required, using {@link #groupingByConcurrent(Function)}
     * may offer better parallel performance.
