     * Returns the absolute value of a {@code long} value.
     * If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned.
     * If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.
     *
     * <p>Note that if the argument is equal to the value of
     * {@link Long#MIN_VALUE}, the most negative representable
     * {@code long} value, the result is that same value, which
     * is negative.
     *
     * @param   a   the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
     * @return  the absolute value of the argument.
