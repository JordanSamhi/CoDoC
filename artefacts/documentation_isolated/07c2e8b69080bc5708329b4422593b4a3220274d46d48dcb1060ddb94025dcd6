     * Registers a zone rules provider.
     * <p>
     * This adds a new provider to those currently available.
     * A provider supplies rules for one or more zone IDs.
     * A provider cannot be registered if it supplies a zone ID that has already been
     * registered. See the notes on time-zone IDs in {@link ZoneId}, especially
     * the section on using the concept of a "group" to make IDs unique.
     * <p>
     * To ensure the integrity of time-zones already created, there is no way
     * to deregister providers.
     *
     * @param provider  the provider to register, not null
     * @throws ZoneRulesException if a zone ID is already registered
