     * Compares two {@code short} values numerically.
     * The value returned is identical to what would be returned by:
     * <pre>
     *    Short.valueOf(x).compareTo(Short.valueOf(y))
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param  x the first {@code short} to compare
     * @param  y the second {@code short} to compare
     * @return the value {@code 0} if {@code x == y};
     *         a value less than {@code 0} if {@code x < y}; and
     *         a value greater than {@code 0} if {@code x > y}
