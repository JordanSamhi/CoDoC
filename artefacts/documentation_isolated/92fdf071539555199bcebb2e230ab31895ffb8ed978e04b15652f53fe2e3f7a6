     * Returns a string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing
     * whitespace removed.
     * <p>
     * If this {@code String} object represents an empty character
     * sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence
     * represented by this {@code String} object both have codes
     * greater than {@code '\u005Cu0020'} (the space character), then a
     * reference to this {@code String} object is returned.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than
     * {@code '\u005Cu0020'} in the string, then a
     * {@code String} object representing an empty string is
     * returned.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, let <i>k</i> be the index of the first character in the
     * string whose code is greater than {@code '\u005Cu0020'}, and let
     * <i>m</i> be the index of the last character in the string whose code
     * is greater than {@code '\u005Cu0020'}. A {@code String}
     * object is returned, representing the substring of this string that
     * begins with the character at index <i>k</i> and ends with the
     * character at index <i>m</i>-that is, the result of
     * {@code this.substring(k, m + 1)}.
     * <p>
     * This method may be used to trim whitespace (as defined above) from
     * the beginning and end of a string.
     *
     * @return  A string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing white
     *          space removed, or this string if it has no leading or
     *          trailing white space.
