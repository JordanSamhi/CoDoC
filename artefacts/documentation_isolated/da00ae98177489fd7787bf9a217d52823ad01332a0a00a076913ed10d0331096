     * Gets a suitable offset for the specified local date-time in these rules.
     * <p>
     * The mapping from a local date-time to an offset is not straightforward.
     * There are three cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
     *  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
     * <li>Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
     *  due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
     *  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
     * <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
     *  due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
     *  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets.
     * This method returns the single offset in the Normal case, and in the Gap or Overlap
     * case it returns the offset before the transition.
     * <p>
     * Since, in the case of Gap and Overlap, the offset returned is a "best" value, rather
     * than the "correct" value, it should be treated with care. Applications that care
     * about the correct offset should use a combination of this method,
     * {@link #getValidOffsets(LocalDateTime)} and {@link #getTransition(LocalDateTime)}.
     *
     * @param localDateTime  the local date-time to query, not null, but null
     *  may be ignored if the rules have a single offset for all instants
     * @return the best available offset for the local date-time, not null
