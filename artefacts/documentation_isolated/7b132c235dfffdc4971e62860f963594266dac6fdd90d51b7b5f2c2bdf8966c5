     * Get an enumeration of known logger names.
     * <p>
     * Note:  Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded.
     * This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered.
     * It is also important to note that this method only returns the name
     * of a Logger, not a strong reference to the Logger itself.
     * The returned String does nothing to prevent the Logger from being
     * garbage collected. In particular, if the returned name is passed
     * to {@code LogManager.getLogger()}, then the caller must check the
     * return value from {@code LogManager.getLogger()} for null to properly
     * handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected in the
     * time since its name was returned by this method.
     * <p>
     * @return  enumeration of logger name strings
