     * @param  readAheadLimit  Limit on the number of characters that may be
     *                         read while still preserving the mark.  Because
     *                         the stream's input comes from a string, there
     *                         is no actual limit, so this argument must not
     *                         be negative, but is otherwise ignored.
     *
     * @exception  IllegalArgumentException  If {@code readAheadLimit < 0}
     * @exception  IOException  If an I/O error occurs
