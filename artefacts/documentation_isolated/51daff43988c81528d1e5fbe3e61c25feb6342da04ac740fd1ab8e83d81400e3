     * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant ticking in whole minutes
     * using best available system clock.
     * <p>
     * This clock will always have the nano-of-second and second-of-minute fields set to zero.
     * This ensures that the visible time ticks in whole minutes.
     * The underlying clock is the best available system clock, equivalent to
     * using {@link #system(ZoneId)}.
     * <p>
     * Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
     * As such, it is possible that the start of the minute observed via this
     * clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
     * It is equivalent to {@code tick(system(zone), Duration.ofMinutes(1))}.
     *
     * @param zone  the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null
     * @return a clock that ticks in whole minutes using the specified zone, not null
