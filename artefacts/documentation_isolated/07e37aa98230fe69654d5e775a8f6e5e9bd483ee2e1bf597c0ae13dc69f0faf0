     * Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
     * skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next
     * invocation of a method for this input stream. The next invocation might be
     * the same thread or another thread.  A single read or skip of this
     * many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
     *
     * <p> The method returns the sum of the number of bytes that have been
     * pushed back and the value returned by {@link
     * java.io.FilterInputStream#available available}.
     *
     * @return     the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from
     *             the input stream without blocking.
     * @exception  IOException  if this input stream has been closed by
     *             invoking its {@link #close()} method,
     *             or an I/O error occurs.
