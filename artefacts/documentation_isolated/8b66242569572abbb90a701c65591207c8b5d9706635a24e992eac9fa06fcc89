     * Returns a hash code based on the contents of the specified array.
     * For any two non-null <tt>int</tt> arrays <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>
     * such that <tt>Arrays.equals(a, b)</tt>, it is also the case that
     * <tt>Arrays.hashCode(a) == Arrays.hashCode(b)</tt>.
     *
     * <p>The value returned by this method is the same value that would be
     * obtained by invoking the {@link List#hashCode() <tt>hashCode</tt>}
     * method on a {@link List} containing a sequence of {@link Integer}
     * instances representing the elements of <tt>a</tt> in the same order.
     * If <tt>a</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, this method returns 0.
