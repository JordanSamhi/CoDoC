     * Determines whether the character is mirrored according to the
     * Unicode specification.  Mirrored characters should have their
     * glyphs horizontally mirrored when displayed in text that is
     * right-to-left.  For example, {@code '\u005Cu0028'} LEFT
     * PARENTHESIS is semantically defined to be an <i>opening
     * parenthesis</i>.  This will appear as a "(" in text that is
     * left-to-right but as a ")" in text that is right-to-left.
