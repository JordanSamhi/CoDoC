     * Returns a {@link Collection} view of the values contained in this map.
     * The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
     * reflected in the collection, and vice-versa.  The collection
     * supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
     * mapping from this map, via the {@code Iterator.remove},
     * {@code Collection.remove}, {@code removeAll},
     * {@code retainAll}, and {@code clear} operations.  It does not
     * support the {@code add} or {@code addAll} operations.
     *
     * <p>The view's iterators and spliterators are
     * <a href="package-summary.html#Weakly"><i>weakly consistent</i></a>.
     *
     * <p>The view's {@code spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#CONCURRENT}
     * and {@link Spliterator#NONNULL}.
