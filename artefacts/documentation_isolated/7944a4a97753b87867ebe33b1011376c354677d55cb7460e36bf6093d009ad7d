     * Generates a certificate object and initializes it with
     * the data read from the input stream {@code inStream}.
     *
     * <p>In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
     * supported by this certificate factory,
     * the returned certificate object can be typecast to the corresponding
     * certificate class. For example, if this certificate
     * factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
     * can be typecast to the {@code X509Certificate} class.
     *
     * <p>In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
     * certificate provided in {@code inStream} must be DER-encoded and
     * may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the
     * certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at
     * the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and must be bounded at
     * the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----.
     *
     * <p>Note that if the given input stream does not support
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int) mark} and
     * {@link java.io.InputStream#reset() reset}, this method will
     * consume the entire input stream. Otherwise, each call to this
     * method consumes one certificate and the read position of the
     * input stream is positioned to the next available byte after
     * the inherent end-of-certificate marker. If the data in the input stream
     * does not contain an inherent end-of-certificate marker (other
     * than EOF) and there is trailing data after the certificate is parsed, a
     * {@code CertificateException} is thrown.
     *
     * @param inStream an input stream with the certificate data.
     *
     * @return a certificate object initialized with the data
     * from the input stream.
     *
     * @exception CertificateException on parsing errors.
