     * Checks if the specified field is supported.
     * <p>
     * This checks if this era can be queried for the specified field.
     * If false, then calling the {@link #range(TemporalField) range} and
     * {@link #get(TemporalField) get} methods will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the query is implemented here.
     * The {@code ERA} field returns true.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will return false.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.
     *
     * @param field  the field to check, null returns false
     * @return true if the field is supported on this era, false if not
