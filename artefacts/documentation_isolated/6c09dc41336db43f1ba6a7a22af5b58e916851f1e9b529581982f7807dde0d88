     * Accepts a function that extracts a {@link java.lang.Comparable
     * Comparable} sort key from a type {@code T}, and returns a {@code
     * Comparator<T>} that compares by that sort key.
     *
     * <p>The returned comparator is serializable if the specified function
     * is also serializable.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * For example, to obtain a {@code Comparator} that compares {@code
     * Person} objects by their last name,
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Comparator<Person> byLastName = Comparator.comparing(Person::getLastName);
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param  <T> the type of element to be compared
     * @param  <U> the type of the {@code Comparable} sort key
     * @param  keyExtractor the function used to extract the {@link
     *         Comparable} sort key
     * @return a comparator that compares by an extracted key
     * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null
