     * Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified
     * {@code fromIndex}, inclusive, and {@code toIndex}, exclusive.  (If
     * {@code fromIndex} and {@code toIndex} are equal, the returned list is
     * empty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural
     * changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
     * The returned list supports all of the optional list operations.
     *
     * <p>This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
     * the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects
     * a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view
     * instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom
     * removes a range of elements from a list:
     * <pre>
     *      list.subList(from, to).clear();
     * </pre>
     * Similar idioms may be constructed for {@link #indexOf(Object)} and
     * {@link #lastIndexOf(Object)}, and all of the algorithms in the
     * {@link Collections} class can be applied to a subList.
     *
     * <p>The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if
     * the backing list (i.e., this list) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
     * any way other than via the returned list.  (Structural modifications are
     * those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such
     * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)
