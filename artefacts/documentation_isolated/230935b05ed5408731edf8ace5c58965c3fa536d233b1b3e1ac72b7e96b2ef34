     * Obtains a {@code ChronoPeriod} consisting of amount of time between two dates.
     * <p>
     * The start date is included, but the end date is not.
     * The period is calculated using {@link ChronoLocalDate#until(ChronoLocalDate)}.
     * As such, the calculation is chronology specific.
     * <p>
     * The chronology of the first date is used.
     * The chronology of the second date is ignored, with the date being converted
     * to the target chronology system before the calculation starts.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method can be a negative period if the end is before the start.
     * In most cases, the positive/negative sign will be the same in each of the supported fields.
     *
     * @param startDateInclusive  the start date, inclusive, specifying the chronology of the calculation, not null
     * @param endDateExclusive  the end date, exclusive, in any chronology, not null
     * @return the period between this date and the end date, not null
