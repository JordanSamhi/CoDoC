     * Copies into the specified array references to every active
     * subgroup in this thread group. If {@code recurse} is
     * {@code true}, this method recursively enumerates all subgroups of this
     * thread group and references to every active thread group in these
     * subgroups are also included.
     *
     * <p> An application might use the
     * {@linkplain #activeGroupCount activeGroupCount} method to
     * get an estimate of how big the array should be, however <i>if the
     * array is too short to hold all the thread groups, the extra thread
     * groups are silently ignored.</i>  If it is critical to obtain every
     * active subgroup in this thread group, the caller should verify that
     * the returned int value is strictly less than the length of
     * {@code list}.
     *
     * <p> Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended
     * that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.
