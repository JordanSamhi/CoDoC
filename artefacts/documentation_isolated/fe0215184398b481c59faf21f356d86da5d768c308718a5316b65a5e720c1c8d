     * Returns a null-friendly comparator that considers {@code null} to be
     * greater than non-null. When both are {@code null}, they are considered
     * equal. If both are non-null, the specified {@code Comparator} is used
     * to determine the order. If the specified comparator is {@code null},
     * then the returned comparator considers all non-null values to be equal.
     *
     * <p>The returned comparator is serializable if the specified comparator
     * is serializable.

     * @return a comparator that considers {@code null} to be greater than
     *         non-null, and compares non-null objects with the supplied
     *         {@code Comparator}.
