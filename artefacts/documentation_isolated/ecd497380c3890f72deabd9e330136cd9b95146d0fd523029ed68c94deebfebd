     * Attempts to acquire in shared mode, aborting if interrupted, and
     * failing if the given timeout elapses.  Implemented by first
     * checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once {@link
     * #tryAcquireShared}, returning on success.  Otherwise, the
     * thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking,
     * invoking {@link #tryAcquireShared} until success or the thread
     * is interrupted or the timeout elapses.
     *
     * @param arg the acquire argument.  This value is conveyed to
     *        {@link #tryAcquireShared} but is otherwise uninterpreted
     *        and can represent anything you like.
     * @param nanosTimeout the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait
     * @return {@code true} if acquired; {@code false} if timed out
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
