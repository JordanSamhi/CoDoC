     * Sets the formats to use for the format elements in the
     * previously set pattern string.
     * The order of formats in <code>newFormats</code> corresponds to
     * the order of format elements in the pattern string.
     * <p>
     * If more formats are provided than needed by the pattern string,
     * the remaining ones are ignored. If fewer formats are provided
     * than needed, then only the first <code>newFormats.length</code>
     * formats are replaced.
     * <p>
     * Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
     * changes during localization, it is generally better to use the
     * {@link #setFormatsByArgumentIndex setFormatsByArgumentIndex}
     * method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the
     * order of elements in the <code>arguments</code> array passed to
     * the <code>format</code> methods or the result array returned by
     * the <code>parse</code> methods.
     *
     * @param newFormats the new formats to use
     * @exception NullPointerException if <code>newFormats</code> is null
