     * Constructs a new {@code FileSystem} to access the contents of a file as a
     * file system.
     *
     * <p> This method makes use of specialized providers that create pseudo file
     * systems where the contents of one or more files is treated as a file
     * system.
     *
     * <p> This method iterates over the {@link FileSystemProvider#installedProviders()
     * installed} providers. It invokes, in turn, each provider's {@link
     * FileSystemProvider#newFileSystem(Path,Map) newFileSystem(Path,Map)} method
     * with an empty map. If a provider returns a file system then the iteration
     * terminates and the file system is returned. If none of the installed
     * providers return a {@code FileSystem} then an attempt is made to locate
     * the provider using the given class loader. If a provider returns a file
     * system then the lookup terminates and the file system is returned.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   loader
     *          the class loader to locate the provider or {@code null} to only
     *          attempt to locate an installed provider
     *
     * @return  a new file system
     *
     * @throws  ProviderNotFoundException
     *          if a provider supporting this file type cannot be located
     * @throws  ServiceConfigurationError
     *          when an error occurs while loading a service provider
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission
