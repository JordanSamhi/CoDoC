     * Deletes a file if it exists.
     *
     * <p> As with the {@link #delete(Path) delete(Path)} method, an
     * implementation may need to examine the file to determine if the file is a
     * directory. Consequently this method may not be atomic with respect to
     * other file system operations.  If the file is a symbolic link, then the
     * symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.
     *
     * <p> If the file is a directory then the directory must be empty. In some
     * implementations a directory has entries for special files or links that
     * are created when the directory is created. In such implementations a
     * directory is considered empty when only the special entries exist.
     *
     * <p> On some operating systems it may not be possible to remove a file when
     * it is open and in use by this Java virtual machine or other programs.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to delete
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file was deleted by this method; {@code
     *          false} if the file could not be deleted because it did not
     *          exist
     *
     * @throws  DirectoryNotEmptyException
     *          if the file is a directory and could not otherwise be deleted
     *          because the directory is not empty <i>(optional specific
     *          exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkDelete(String)} method
     *          is invoked to check delete access to the file.
