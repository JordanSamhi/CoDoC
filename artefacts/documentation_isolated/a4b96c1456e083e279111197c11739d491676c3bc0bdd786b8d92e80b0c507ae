     * Tests this abstract pathname for equality with the given object.
     * Returns <code>true</code> if and only if the argument is not
     * <code>null</code> and is an abstract pathname that denotes the same file
     * or directory as this abstract pathname.  Whether or not two abstract
     * pathnames are equal depends upon the underlying system.  On UNIX
     * systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
     * systems it is not.
     *
     * @param   obj   The object to be compared with this abstract pathname
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the objects are the same;
     *          <code>false</code> otherwise
