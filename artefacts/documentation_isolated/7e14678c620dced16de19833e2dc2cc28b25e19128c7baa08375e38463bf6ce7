     * Retrieves the native byte order of the underlying platform.
     *
     * <p> This method is defined so that performance-sensitive Java code can
     * allocate direct buffers with the same byte order as the hardware.
     * Native code libraries are often more efficient when such buffers are
     * used.  </p>
     *
     * @return  The native byte order of the hardware upon which this Java
     *          virtual machine is running
