     * Compares two {@code Character} objects numerically.
     *
     * @param   anotherCharacter   the {@code Character} to be compared.

     * @return  the value {@code 0} if the argument {@code Character}
     *          is equal to this {@code Character}; a value less than
     *          {@code 0} if this {@code Character} is numerically less
     *          than the {@code Character} argument; and a value greater than
     *          {@code 0} if this {@code Character} is numerically greater
     *          than the {@code Character} argument (unsigned comparison).
     *          Note that this is strictly a numerical comparison; it is not
     *          locale-dependent.
