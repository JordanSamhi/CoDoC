     * Sets the package default assertion status for the named package.  The
     * package default assertion status determines the assertion status for
     * classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or
     * any of its "subpackages".
     *
     * <p> A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins
     * with "<tt>p.</tt>".  For example, <tt>javax.swing.text</tt> is a
     * subpackage of <tt>javax.swing</tt>, and both <tt>java.util</tt> and
     * <tt>java.lang.reflect</tt> are subpackages of <tt>java</tt>.
     *
     * <p> In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class,
     * the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes
     * precedence over the others.  For example, if <tt>javax.lang</tt> and
     * <tt>javax.lang.reflect</tt> both have package defaults associated with
     * them, the latter package default applies to classes in
     * <tt>javax.lang.reflect</tt>.
     *
     * <p> Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default
     * assertion status, and may be overridden on a per-class basis by invoking
     * {@link #setClassAssertionStatus(String, boolean)}.  </p>
     *
     * @param  packageName
     *         The name of the package whose package default assertion status
     *         is to be set. A <tt>null</tt> value indicates the unnamed
     *         package that is "current"
     *         (see section 7.4.2 of
     *         <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>.)
     *
     * @param  enabled
     *         <tt>true</tt> if classes loaded by this classloader and
     *         belonging to the named package or any of its subpackages will
     *         have assertions enabled by default, <tt>false</tt> if they will
     *         have assertions disabled by default.
