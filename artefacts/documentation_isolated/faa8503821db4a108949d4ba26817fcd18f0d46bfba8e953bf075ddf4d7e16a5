     * Determines the interfaces implemented by the class or interface
     * represented by this object.
     *
     * <p> If this object represents a class, the return value is an array
     * containing objects representing all interfaces implemented by the
     * class. The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds to
     * the order of the interface names in the {@code implements} clause
     * of the declaration of the class represented by this object. For
     * example, given the declaration:
     * <blockquote>
     * {@code class Shimmer implements FloorWax, DessertTopping { ... }}
     * </blockquote>
     * suppose the value of {@code s} is an instance of
     * {@code Shimmer}; the value of the expression:
     * <blockquote>
     * {@code s.getClass().getInterfaces()[0]}
     * </blockquote>
     * is the {@code Class} object that represents interface
     * {@code FloorWax}; and the value of:
     * <blockquote>
     * {@code s.getClass().getInterfaces()[1]}
     * </blockquote>
     * is the {@code Class} object that represents interface
     * {@code DessertTopping}.
     *
     * <p> If this object represents an interface, the array contains objects
     * representing all interfaces extended by the interface. The order of the
     * interface objects in the array corresponds to the order of the interface
     * names in the {@code extends} clause of the declaration of the
     * interface represented by this object.
     *
     * <p> If this object represents a class or interface that implements no
     * interfaces, the method returns an array of length 0.
     *
     * <p> If this object represents a primitive type or void, the method
     * returns an array of length 0.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an array type, the
     * interfaces {@code Cloneable} and {@code java.io.Serializable} are
     * returned in that order.
     *
     * @return an array of interfaces implemented by this class.
