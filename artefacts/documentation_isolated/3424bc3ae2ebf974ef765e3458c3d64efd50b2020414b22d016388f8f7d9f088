     * Provides programmatic access to the stack trace information printed by
     * {@link #printStackTrace()}.  Returns an array of stack trace elements,
     * each representing one stack frame.  The zeroth element of the array
     * (assuming the array's length is non-zero) represents the top of the
     * stack, which is the last method invocation in the sequence.  Typically,
     * this is the point at which this throwable was created and thrown.
     * The last element of the array (assuming the array's length is non-zero)
     * represents the bottom of the stack, which is the first method invocation
     * in the sequence.
     *
     * <p>Some virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
     * or more stack frames from the stack trace.  In the extreme case,
     * a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
     * this throwable is permitted to return a zero-length array from this
     * method.  Generally speaking, the array returned by this method will
     * contain one element for every frame that would be printed by
     * {@code printStackTrace}.  Writes to the returned array do not
     * affect future calls to this method.
