     * Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
     * directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname that
     * satisfy the specified filter.  The behavior of this method is the same
     * as that of the {@link #listFiles()} method, except that the pathnames in
     * the returned array must satisfy the filter.  If the given {@code filter}
     * is {@code null} then all pathnames are accepted.  Otherwise, a pathname
     * satisfies the filter if and only if the value {@code true} results when
     * the {@link FileFilter#accept FileFilter.accept(File)} method of the
     * filter is invoked on the pathname.

     * @param  filter
     *         A file filter
     *
     * @return  An array of abstract pathnames denoting the files and
     *          directories in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
     *          The array will be empty if the directory is empty.  Returns
     *          {@code null} if this abstract pathname does not denote a
     *          directory, or if an I/O error occurs.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method denies read access to
     *          the directory
