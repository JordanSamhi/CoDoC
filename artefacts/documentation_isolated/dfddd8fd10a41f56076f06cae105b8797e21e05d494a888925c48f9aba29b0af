     * Gets the duration of the transition.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, the transition duration is one hour, however this is not always the case.
     * The duration will be positive for a gap and negative for an overlap.
     * Time-zones are second-based, so the nanosecond part of the duration will be zero.
     *
     * @return the duration of the transition, positive for gaps, negative for overlaps
