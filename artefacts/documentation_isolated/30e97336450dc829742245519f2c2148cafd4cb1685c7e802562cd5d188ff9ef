     * Returns the arithmetic mean of values recorded, or zero if no
     * values have been recorded.
     *
     * If any recorded value is a NaN or the sum is at any point a NaN
     * then the average will be code NaN.
     *
     * <p>The average returned can vary depending upon the order in
     * which values are recorded.
     *
     * This method may be implemented using compensated summation or
     * other technique to reduce the error bound in the {@link #getSum
     * numerical sum} used to compute the average.
     *
     * @apiNote Values sorted by increasing absolute magnitude tend to yield
     * more accurate results.
     *
     * @return the arithmetic mean of values, or zero if none
