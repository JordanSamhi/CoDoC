     * Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
     * blocking until all are available,
     * or the thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
     * and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
     * by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
     * loop {@code for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquire();} except
     * that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:
     *
     * <p>If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
     * disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
     * one of two things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes one of the {@link #release() release}
     * methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
     * permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * for a permit,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     * Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread are instead
     * assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
     * permits had been made available by a call to {@link #release()}.
     *
     * @param permits the number of permits to acquire
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code permits} is negative
