     * <p>
     * This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
     * The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
     * If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
     * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the query is implemented here.
     * The {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will return valid
     * values based on this time, except {@code NANO_OF_DAY} and {@code MICRO_OF_DAY}
     * which are too large to fit in an {@code int} and throw a {@code DateTimeException}.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
     * and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported or
     *         the range of values exceeds an {@code int}
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
