     * Gets an immutable collection of subject alternative names from the
     * {@code SubjectAltName} extension, (OID = 2.5.29.17).
     * <p>
     * The ASN.1 definition of the {@code SubjectAltName} extension is:
     * <pre>
     * SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames
     *
     * GeneralNames :: = SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName
     *
     * GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
     *      otherName                       [0]     OtherName,
     *      rfc822Name                      [1]     IA5String,
     *      dNSName                         [2]     IA5String,
     *      x400Address                     [3]     ORAddress,
     *      directoryName                   [4]     Name,
     *      ediPartyName                    [5]     EDIPartyName,
     *      uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IA5String,
     *      iPAddress                       [7]     OCTET STRING,
     *      registeredID                    [8]     OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * If this certificate does not contain a {@code SubjectAltName}
     * extension, {@code null} is returned. Otherwise, a
     * {@code Collection} is returned with an entry representing each
     * {@code GeneralName} included in the extension. Each entry is a
     * {@code List} whose first entry is an {@code Integer}
     * (the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a {@code String}
     * or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form,
     * respectively).
     * <p>
     * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</a>, DNS, and URI
     * names are returned as {@code String}s,
     * using the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
     * the restrictions included in RFC 3280). IPv4 address names are
     * returned using dotted quad notation. IPv6 address names are returned
     * in the form "a1:a2:...:a8", where a1-a8 are hexadecimal values
     * representing the eight 16-bit pieces of the address. OID names are
     * returned as {@code String}s represented as a series of nonnegative
     * integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names)
     * are returned in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt">
     * RFC 2253</a> string format. No standard string format is
     * defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, or any
     * other type of names. They are returned as byte arrays
     * containing the ASN.1 DER encoded form of the name.
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code Collection} returned may contain more
     * than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned
     * {@code Collection} is immutable and any entries containing byte
     * arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.
     * <p>
     * This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
     * Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
     * service providers, this method is not {@code abstract}
     * and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
     * should override this method with a correct implementation.
     *
     * @return an immutable {@code Collection} of subject alternative
     * names (or {@code null})
     * @throws CertificateParsingException if the extension cannot be decoded
     * @since 1.4
