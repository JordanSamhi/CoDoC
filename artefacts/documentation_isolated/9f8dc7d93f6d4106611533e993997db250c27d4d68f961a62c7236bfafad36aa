     * Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in
     * this vector, searching backwards from {@code index}, or returns -1 if
     * the element is not found.
     * More formally, returns the highest index {@code i} such that
     * <tt>(i&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;index&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;(o==null&nbsp;?&nbsp;get(i)==null&nbsp;:&nbsp;o.equals(get(i))))</tt>,
     * or -1 if there is no such index.
     *
     * @param o element to search for
     * @param index index to start searching backwards from
     * @return the index of the last occurrence of the element at position
     *         less than or equal to {@code index} in this vector;
     *         -1 if the element is not found.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the specified index is greater
     *         than or equal to the current size of this vector
