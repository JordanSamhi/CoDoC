     * Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
     * skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next
     * invocation of a method for this input stream. The next invocation
     * might be the same thread or another thread.  A single read or skip of this
     * many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
     *
     * <p> Note that while some implementations of {@code InputStream} will return
     * the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not.  It is
     * never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate
     * a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.
     *
     * <p> A subclass' implementation of this method may choose to throw an
     * {@link IOException} if this input stream has been closed by
     * invoking the {@link #close()} method.
     *
     * <p> The {@code available} method for class {@code InputStream} always
     * returns {@code 0}.
     *
     * <p> This method should be overridden by subclasses.
     *
     * @return     an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
     *             over) from this input stream without blocking or {@code 0} when
     *             it reaches the end of the input stream.
     * @exception  IOException if an I/O error occurs.
