     * Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
     * of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * <p>
     * This combines this local date-time and the specified offset to calculate the
     * epoch-second value, which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation calculates from the epoch-day of the date and the
     * second-of-day of the time.
     *
     * @param offset  the offset to use for the conversion, not null
     * @return the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
