     * Converts all of the characters in this {@code String} to upper
     * case using the rules of the default locale. This method is equivalent to
     * {@code toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())}.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> This method is locale sensitive, and may produce unexpected
     * results if used for strings that are intended to be interpreted locale
     * independently.
     * Examples are programming language identifiers, protocol keys, and HTML
     * tags.
     * For instance, {@code "title".toUpperCase()} in a Turkish locale
     * returns {@code "T\u005Cu0130TLE"}, where '\u005Cu0130' is the
     * LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE character.
     * To obtain correct results for locale insensitive strings, use
     * {@code toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)}.
     * <p>
     * @return  the {@code String}, converted to uppercase.
     * @see     java.lang.String#toUpperCase(Locale)
