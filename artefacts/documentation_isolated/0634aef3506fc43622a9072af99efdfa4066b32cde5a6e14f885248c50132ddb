     * Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the
     * specified character, starting the search at the specified index.
     * <p>
     * If a character with value {@code ch} occurs in the
     * character sequence represented by this {@code String}
     * object at an index no smaller than {@code fromIndex}, then
     * the index of the first such occurrence is returned. For values
     * of {@code ch} in the range from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive),
     * this is the smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * (this.charAt(<i>k</i>) == ch) {@code &&} (<i>k</i> &gt;= fromIndex)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. For other values of {@code ch}, it is the
     * smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * (this.codePointAt(<i>k</i>) == ch) {@code &&} (<i>k</i> &gt;= fromIndex)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this
     * string at or after position {@code fromIndex}, then
     * {@code -1} is returned.
     *
     * <p>
     * There is no restriction on the value of {@code fromIndex}. If it
     * is negative, it has the same effect as if it were zero: this entire
     * string may be searched. If it is greater than the length of this
     * string, it has the same effect as if it were equal to the length of
     * this string: {@code -1} is returned.
     *
     * <p>All indices are specified in {@code char} values
     * (Unicode code units).
     *
     * @param   ch          a character (Unicode code point).
     * @param   fromIndex   the index to start the search from.
     * @return  the index of the first occurrence of the character in the
     *          character sequence represented by this object that is greater
     *          than or equal to {@code fromIndex}, or {@code -1}
     *          if the character does not occur.
