     * Returns a string representation of the {@code long}
     * argument as an unsigned integer in base&nbsp;16.
     *
     * <p>The unsigned {@code long} value is the argument plus
     * 2<sup>64</sup> if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is
     * equal to the argument.  This value is converted to a string of
     * ASCII digits in hexadecimal (base&nbsp;16) with no extra
     * leading {@code 0}s.
     *
     * <p>The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned
     * string {@code s} by calling {@link
     * Long#parseUnsignedLong(String, int) Long.parseUnsignedLong(s,
     * 16)}.
     *
     * <p>If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a
     * single zero character {@code '0'} ({@code '\u005Cu0030'});
     * otherwise, the first character of the representation of the
     * unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The
     * following characters are used as hexadecimal digits:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code 0123456789abcdef}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * These are the characters {@code '\u005Cu0030'} through
     * {@code '\u005Cu0039'} and  {@code '\u005Cu0061'} through
     * {@code '\u005Cu0066'}.  If uppercase letters are desired,
     * the {@link java.lang.String#toUpperCase()} method may be called
     * on the result:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code Long.toHexString(n).toUpperCase()}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @param   i   a {@code long} to be converted to a string.
     * @return  the string representation of the unsigned {@code long}
     *          value represented by the argument in hexadecimal
     *          (base&nbsp;16).
