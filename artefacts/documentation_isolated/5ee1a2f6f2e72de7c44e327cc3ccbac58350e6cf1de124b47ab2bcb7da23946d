     * Removes a single instance of the specified element from this deque.
     * If the deque does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
     * More formally, removes the first element {@code e} such that
     * {@code o.equals(e)} (if such an element exists).
     * Returns {@code true} if this deque contained the specified element
     * (or equivalently, if this deque changed as a result of the call).
     *
     * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #removeFirstOccurrence(Object)}.
     *
     * @param o element to be removed from this deque, if present
     * @return {@code true} if this deque contained the specified element
