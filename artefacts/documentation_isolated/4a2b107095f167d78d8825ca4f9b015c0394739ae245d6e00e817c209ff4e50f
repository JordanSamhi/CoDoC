     * Returns a copy of this {@code OffsetDateTime} with the specified number of years subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This method subtracts the specified amount from the years field in three steps:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Subtract the input years from the year field</li>
     * <li>Check if the resulting date would be invalid</li>
     * <li>Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * For example, 2008-02-29 (leap year) minus one year would result in the
     * invalid date 2009-02-29 (standard year). Instead of returning an invalid
     * result, the last valid day of the month, 2009-02-28, is selected instead.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param years  the years to subtract, may be negative
     * @return an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on this date-time with the years subtracted, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
