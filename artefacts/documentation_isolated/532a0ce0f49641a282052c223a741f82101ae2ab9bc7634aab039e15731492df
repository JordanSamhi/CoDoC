     * Causes the next added printer/parser to pad to a fixed width using a space.
     * <p>
     * This padding will pad to a fixed width using spaces.
     * <p>
     * During formatting, the decorated element will be output and then padded
     * to the specified width. An exception will be thrown during formatting if
     * the pad width is exceeded.
     * <p>
     * During parsing, the padding and decorated element are parsed.
     * If parsing is lenient, then the pad width is treated as a maximum.
     * The padding is parsed greedily. Thus, if the decorated element starts with
     * the pad character, it will not be parsed.
     *
     * @param padWidth  the pad width, 1 or greater
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if pad width is too small
