     * Returns an object that delegates all defined {@link
     * ScheduledExecutorService} methods to the given executor, but
     * not any other methods that might otherwise be accessible using
     * casts. This provides a way to safely "freeze" configuration and
     * disallow tuning of a given concrete implementation.
     * @param executor the underlying implementation
     * @return a {@code ScheduledExecutorService} instance
     * @throws NullPointerException if executor null
