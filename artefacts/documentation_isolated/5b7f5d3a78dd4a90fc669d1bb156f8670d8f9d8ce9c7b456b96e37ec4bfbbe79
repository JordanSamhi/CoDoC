     * Changes the parse style to be strict for the remainder of the formatter.
     * <p>
     * Parsing can be strict or lenient - by default its strict.
     * This controls the degree of flexibility in matching the text and sign styles.
     * <p>
     * When used, this method changes the parsing to be strict from this point onwards.
     * As strict is the default, this is normally only needed after calling {@link #parseLenient()}.
     * The change will remain in force until the end of the formatter that is eventually
     * constructed or until {@code parseLenient} is called.
     *
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
