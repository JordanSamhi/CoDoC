     * Returns a copy of this time with the specified field set to a new value.
     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code OffsetTime}, based on this one, with the value
     * for the specified field changed.
     * This can be used to change any supported field, such as the hour, minute or second.
     * If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
     * some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
     * <p>
     * The {@code OFFSET_SECONDS} field will return a time with the specified offset.
     * The local time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
     * then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * The other {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will behave as per
     * the matching method on {@link LocalTime#with(TemporalField, long)} LocalTime}.
     * In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
     * <p>
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the field determines
     * whether and how to adjust the instant.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
