     * Returns a new bit set containing all the bits in the given long
     * buffer between its position and limit.
     *
     * <p>More precisely,
     * <br>{@code BitSet.valueOf(lb).get(n) == ((lb.get(lb.position()+n/64) & (1L<<(n%64))) != 0)}
     * <br>for all {@code n < 64 * lb.remaining()}.
     *
     * <p>The long buffer is not modified by this method, and no
     * reference to the buffer is retained by the bit set.
     *
     * @param lb a long buffer containing a little-endian representation
     *        of a sequence of bits between its position and limit, to be
     *        used as the initial bits of the new bit set
     * @return a {@code BitSet} containing all the bits in the buffer in the
     *         specified range
     * @since 1.7
