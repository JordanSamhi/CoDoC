     * Sets the subjectKeyIdentifier criterion. The
     * {@code X509Certificate} must contain a SubjectKeyIdentifier
     * extension for which the contents of the extension
     * matches the specified criterion value.
     * If the criterion value is {@code null}, no
     * subjectKeyIdentifier check will be done.
     * <p>
     * If {@code subjectKeyID} is not {@code null}, it
     * should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents
     * of the extension value (not including the object identifier,
     * criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING)
     * for a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension.
     * The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= KeyIdentifier
     *
     * KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING
     * }</pre>
     * <p>
     * Since the format of subject key identifiers is not mandated by
     * any standard, subject key identifiers are not parsed by the
     * {@code X509CertSelector}. Instead, the values are compared using
     * a byte-by-byte comparison.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
