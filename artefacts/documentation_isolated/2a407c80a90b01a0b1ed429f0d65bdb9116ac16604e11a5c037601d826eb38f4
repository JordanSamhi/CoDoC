     * Overrides Format.
     * Formats a time object into a time string. Examples of time objects
     * are a time value expressed in milliseconds and a Date object.
     * @param obj must be a Number or a Date.
     * @param toAppendTo the string buffer for the returning time string.
     * @return the string buffer passed in as toAppendTo, with formatted text appended.
     * @param fieldPosition keeps track of the position of the field
     * within the returned string.
     * On input: an alignment field,
     * if desired. On output: the offsets of the alignment field. For
     * example, given a time text "1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT",
     * if the given fieldPosition is DateFormat.YEAR_FIELD, the
     * begin index and end index of fieldPosition will be set to
     * 0 and 4, respectively.
     * Notice that if the same time field appears
     * more than once in a pattern, the fieldPosition will be set for the first
     * occurrence of that time field. For instance, formatting a Date to
     * the time string "1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)" using the pattern
     * "h a z (zzzz)" and the alignment field DateFormat.TIMEZONE_FIELD,
     * the begin index and end index of fieldPosition will be set to
     * 5 and 8, respectively, for the first occurrence of the timezone
     * pattern character 'z'.
