     * Returns a copy of this {@code OffsetDateTime} with the specified number of weeks subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This method subtracts the specified amount in weeks from the days field decrementing
     * the month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid.
     * The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded.
     * <p>
     * For example, 2008-12-31 minus one week would result in 2009-01-07.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param weeks  the weeks to subtract, may be negative
     * @return an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on this date-time with the weeks subtracted, not null
