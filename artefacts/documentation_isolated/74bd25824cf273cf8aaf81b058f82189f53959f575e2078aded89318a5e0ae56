     * Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value
     * according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "single format" bit
     * layout.
     *
     * <p>Bit 31 (the bit that is selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x80000000}) represents the sign of the floating-point
     * number.
     * Bits 30-23 (the bits that are selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x7f800000}) represent the exponent.
     * Bits 22-0 (the bits that are selected by the mask
     * {@code 0x007fffff}) represent the significand (sometimes called
     * the mantissa) of the floating-point number.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
     * {@code 0x7f800000}.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
     * {@code 0xff800000}.
     *
     * <p>If the argument is NaN, the result is {@code 0x7fc00000}.
     *
     * <p>In all cases, the result is an integer that, when given to the
     * {@link #intBitsToFloat(int)} method, will produce a floating-point
     * value the same as the argument to {@code floatToIntBits}
     * (except all NaN values are collapsed to a single
     * "canonical" NaN value).
     *
     * @param   value   a floating-point number.
     * @return the bits that represent the floating-point number.
