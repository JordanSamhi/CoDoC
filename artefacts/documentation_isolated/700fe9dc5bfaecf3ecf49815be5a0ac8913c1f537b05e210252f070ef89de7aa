     *  milliseconds. With this option set to a non-zero timeout,
     *  a call to receive() for this DatagramSocket
     *  will block for only this amount of time.  If the timeout expires,
     *  a <B>java.net.SocketTimeoutException</B> is raised, though the

     *  A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

     * @param timeout the specified timeout in milliseconds.
     * @throws SocketException if there is an error in the underlying protocol, such as an UDP error.
