         * Returns an encoder instance that encodes equivalently to this one,
         * but without adding any padding character at the end of the encoded
         * byte data.
         *
         * <p> The encoding scheme of this encoder instance is unaffected by
         * this invocation. The returned encoder instance should be used for
         * non-padding encoding operation.

         * @return an equivalent encoder that encodes without adding any
