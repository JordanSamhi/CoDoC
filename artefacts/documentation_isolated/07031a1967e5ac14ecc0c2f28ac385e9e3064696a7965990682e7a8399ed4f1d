     * Determines the number of {@code char} values needed to
     * represent the specified character (Unicode code point). If the
     * specified character is equal to or greater than 0x10000, then
     * the method returns 2. Otherwise, the method returns 1.
     *
     * <p>This method doesn't validate the specified character to be a
     * valid Unicode code point. The caller must validate the
     * character value using {@link #isValidCodePoint(int) isValidCodePoint}
     * if necessary.
     *
     * @param   codePoint the character (Unicode code point) to be tested.
     * @return  2 if the character is a valid supplementary character; 1 otherwise.
