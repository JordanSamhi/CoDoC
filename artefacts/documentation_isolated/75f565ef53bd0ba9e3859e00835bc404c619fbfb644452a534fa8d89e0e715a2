     * Returns a lexicographic-order comparator with a function that
     * extracts a key to be compared with the given {@code Comparator}.
     *
     * @implSpec This default implementation behaves as if {@code
     *           thenComparing(comparing(keyExtractor, cmp))}.
     *
     * @param  <U>  the type of the sort key
     * @param  keyExtractor the function used to extract the sort key
     * @param  keyComparator the {@code Comparator} used to compare the sort key
     * @return a lexicographic-order comparator composed of this comparator
     *         and then comparing on the key extracted by the keyExtractor function
     * @throws NullPointerException if either argument is null.
