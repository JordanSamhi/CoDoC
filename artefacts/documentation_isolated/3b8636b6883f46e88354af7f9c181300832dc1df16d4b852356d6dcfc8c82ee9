     * Returns the language code of this Locale.
     *
     * <p><b>Note:</b> ISO 639 is not a stable standard&mdash; some languages' codes have changed.
     * Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
     * whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code.  If you
     * want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do
     * <pre>
     * if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) // BAD!
     *    ...
     * </pre>
     * Instead, do
     * <pre>
     * if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he").getLanguage()))
     *    ...
     * </pre>
     * @return The language code, or the empty string if none is defined.
     * @see #getDisplayLanguage
