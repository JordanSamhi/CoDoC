     * then the token is converted into a <tt>double</tt> value as if by
     * removing all locale specific prefixes, group separators, and locale
     * specific suffixes, then mapping non-ASCII digits into ASCII
     * digits via {@link Character#digit Character.digit}, prepending a
     * negative sign (-) if the locale specific negative prefixes and suffixes
     * were present, and passing the resulting string to
     * {@link Double#parseDouble Double.parseDouble}. If the token matches
     * the localized NaN or infinity strings, then either "Nan" or "Infinity"
     * is passed to {@link Double#parseDouble(String) Double.parseDouble} as
     * appropriate.
