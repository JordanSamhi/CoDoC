     * Creates a newly allocated string. Its size is the current size of
     * the output stream and the valid contents of the buffer have been
     * copied into it. Each character <i>c</i> in the resulting string is
     * constructed from the corresponding element <i>b</i> in the byte
     * array such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     c == (char)(((hibyte &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8) | (b &amp; 0xff))
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @deprecated This method does not properly convert bytes into characters.
     * As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the
     * <code>toString(String enc)</code> method, which takes an encoding-name
     * argument, or the <code>toString()</code> method, which uses the
     * platform's default character encoding.
     *
     * @param      hibyte    the high byte of each resulting Unicode character.
     * @return     the current contents of the output stream, as a string.
