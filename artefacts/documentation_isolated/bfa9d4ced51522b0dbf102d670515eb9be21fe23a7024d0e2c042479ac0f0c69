     * Walks a file tree.
     *
     * <p> This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
     * file tree traversal is <em>depth-first</em> with the given {@link
     * FileVisitor} invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
     * completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
     * visit method returns a result of {@link FileVisitResult#TERMINATE
     * TERMINATE}. Where a visit method terminates due an {@code IOException},
     * an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
     * and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method.
     *
     * <p> For each file encountered this method attempts to read its {@link
     * java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes}. If the file is not a
     * directory then the {@link FileVisitor#visitFile visitFile} method is
     * invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
     * due to an I/O exception, then the {@link FileVisitor#visitFileFailed
     * visitFileFailed} method is invoked with the I/O exception.
     *
     * <p> Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
     * then the {@code visitFileFailed} method is invoked with the I/O exception,
     * after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next
     * <em>sibling</em> of the directory.
     *
     * <p> Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
     * directory, and their <em>descendants</em> are visited. When all entries
     * have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
     * directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's {@link
     * FileVisitor#postVisitDirectory postVisitDirectory} method is invoked.
     * The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next <em>sibling</em>
     * of the directory.
     *
     * <p> By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
     * method. If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link
     * FileVisitOption#FOLLOW_LINKS FOLLOW_LINKS} option then symbolic links are
     * followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
     * be read, then this method attempts to get the {@code BasicFileAttributes}
     * of the link. If they can be read then the {@code visitFile} method is
     * invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the {@code visitFileFailed}
     * method is invoked as specified above).
     *
     * <p> If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link
     * FileVisitOption#FOLLOW_LINKS FOLLOW_LINKS} option then this method keeps
     * track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
     * arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
     * directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the {@link
     * java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes#fileKey file-key} of directories,
     * or if file keys are not available, by invoking the {@link #isSameFile
     * isSameFile} method to test if a directory is the same file as an
     * ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the
     * {@link FileVisitor#visitFileFailed visitFileFailed} method is invoked with
     * an instance of {@link FileSystemLoopException}.
     *
     * <p> The {@code maxDepth} parameter is the maximum number of levels of
     * directories to visit. A value of {@code 0} means that only the starting
     * file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of
     * {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE MAX_VALUE} may be used to indicate that all
     * levels should be visited. The {@code visitFile} method is invoked for all
     * files, including directories, encountered at {@code maxDepth}, unless the
     * basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the {@code
     * visitFileFailed} method is invoked.
     *
     * <p> If a visitor returns a result of {@code null} then {@code
     * NullPointerException} is thrown.
     *
     * <p> When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
     * (or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
     * that file (or directory).
