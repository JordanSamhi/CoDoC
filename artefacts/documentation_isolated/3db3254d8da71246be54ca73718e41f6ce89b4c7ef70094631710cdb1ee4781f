     * Returns the channel inherited from the entity that created this
     * Java virtual machine.
     *
     * <p> On many operating systems a process, such as a Java virtual
     * machine, can be started in a manner that allows the process to
     * inherit a channel from the entity that created the process. The
     * manner in which this is done is system dependent, as are the
     * possible entities to which the channel may be connected. For example,
     * on UNIX systems, the Internet services daemon (<i>inetd</i>) is used to
     * start programs to service requests when a request arrives on an
     * associated network port. In this example, the process that is started,
     * inherits a channel representing a network socket.
     *
     * <p> In cases where the inherited channel represents a network socket
     * then the {@link java.nio.channels.Channel Channel} type returned
     * by this method is determined as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     *  <li><p> If the inherited channel represents a stream-oriented connected
     *  socket then a {@link java.nio.channels.SocketChannel SocketChannel} is
     *  returned. The socket channel is, at least initially, in blocking
     *  mode, bound to a socket address, and connected to a peer.
     *  </p></li>
     *
     *  <li><p> If the inherited channel represents a stream-oriented listening
     *  socket then a {@link java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel
     *  ServerSocketChannel} is returned. The server-socket channel is, at
     *  least initially, in blocking mode, and bound to a socket address.
     *  </p></li>
     *
     *  <li><p> If the inherited channel is a datagram-oriented socket
     *  then a {@link java.nio.channels.DatagramChannel DatagramChannel} is
     *  returned. The datagram channel is, at least initially, in blocking
     *  mode, and bound to a socket address.
     *  </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> In addition to the network-oriented channels described, this method
     * may return other kinds of channels in the future.
     *
     * <p> The first invocation of this method creates the channel that is
     * returned. Subsequent invocations of this method return the same
     * channel. </p>
     *
     * @return  The inherited channel, if any, otherwise <tt>null</tt>.

     * @throws  IOException

     *          {@link RuntimePermission}<tt>("inheritedChannel")</tt>
