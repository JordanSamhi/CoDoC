     * Returns the {@code int} value that the specified Unicode
     * character represents. For example, the character
     * {@code '\u005Cu216C'} (the roman numeral fifty) will return
     * an int with a value of 50.
     * <p>
     * The letters A-Z in their uppercase ({@code '\u005Cu0041'} through
     * {@code '\u005Cu005A'}), lowercase
     * ({@code '\u005Cu0061'} through {@code '\u005Cu007A'}), and
     * full width variant ({@code '\u005CuFF21'} through
     * {@code '\u005CuFF3A'} and {@code '\u005CuFF41'} through
     * {@code '\u005CuFF5A'}) forms have numeric values from 10
     * through 35. This is independent of the Unicode specification,
     * which does not assign numeric values to these {@code char}
     * values.
     * <p>
     * If the character does not have a numeric value, then -1 is returned.
     * If the character has a numeric value that cannot be represented as a
     * nonnegative integer (for example, a fractional value), then -2
     * is returned.
     *

     *          nonnegative integer; -1 if the character has no numeric value.
