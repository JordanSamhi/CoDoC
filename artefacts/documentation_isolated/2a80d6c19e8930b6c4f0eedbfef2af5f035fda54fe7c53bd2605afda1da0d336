     * Converts this date-time to the number of seconds from the epoch
     * of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * <p>
     * This uses the {@linkplain #toLocalDateTime() local date-time} and
     * {@linkplain #getOffset() offset} to calculate the epoch-second value,
     * which is the number of elapsed seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
     * Instants on the time-line after the epoch are positive, earlier are negative.

     * @return the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
