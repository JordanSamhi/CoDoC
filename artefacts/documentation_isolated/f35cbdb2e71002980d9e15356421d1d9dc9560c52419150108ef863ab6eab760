     * Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread within the given
     * waiting time and the current thread has not been
     * {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread and returns
     * immediately with the value {@code true}, setting the lock hold count
     * to one. If this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy then
     * an available lock <em>will not</em> be acquired if any other threads
     * are waiting for the lock. This is in contrast to the {@link #tryLock()}
     * method. If you want a timed {@code tryLock} that does permit barging on
     * a fair lock then combine the timed and un-timed forms together:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * if (lock.tryLock() ||
     *     lock.tryLock(timeout, unit)) {
     *   ...
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>If the current thread
     * already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and
     * the method returns {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>If the lock is held by another thread then the
     * current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
     * purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>The lock is acquired by the current thread; or
     *
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     *
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the lock is acquired then the value {@code true} is returned and
     * the lock hold count is set to one.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     *
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while
     * acquiring the lock,
     *
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then the value {@code false}
     * is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
     * will not wait at all.
     *
     * <p>In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
     * interruption point, preference is given to responding to the
     * interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the lock, and
     * over reporting the elapse of the waiting time.
     *
     * @param timeout the time to wait for the lock
     * @param unit the time unit of the timeout argument
     * @return {@code true} if the lock was free and was acquired by the
     *         current thread, or the lock was already held by the current
     *         thread; and {@code false} if the waiting time elapsed before
     *         the lock could be acquired
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     * @throws NullPointerException if the time unit is null
