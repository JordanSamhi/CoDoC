     * Copies all bytes from a file to an output stream.
     *
     * <p> If an I/O error occurs reading from the file or writing to the output
     * stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or written.
     * Consequently the output stream may be in an inconsistent state. It is
     * strongly recommended that the output stream be promptly closed if an I/O
     * error occurs.
     *
     * <p> This method may block indefinitely writing to the output stream (or
     * reading from the file). The behavior for the case that the output stream
     * is <i>asynchronously closed</i> or the thread interrupted during the copy
     * is highly output stream and file system provider specific and therefore
     * not specified.
     *
     * <p> Note that if the given output stream is {@link java.io.Flushable}
     * then its {@link java.io.Flushable#flush flush} method may need to invoked
     * after this method completes so as to flush any buffered output.
     *
     * @param   source
     *          the  path to the file
     * @param   out
     *          the output stream to write to
     *
     * @return  the number of bytes read or written
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
