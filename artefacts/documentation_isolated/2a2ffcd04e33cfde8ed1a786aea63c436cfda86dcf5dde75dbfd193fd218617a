     * Parses the string argument as a signed decimal {@code
     * short}. The characters in the string must all be decimal
     * digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus
     * sign {@code '-'} ({@code '\u005Cu002D'}) to indicate a
     * negative value or an ASCII plus sign {@code '+'}
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002B'}) to indicate a positive value.  The
     * resulting {@code short} value is returned, exactly as if the
     * argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the {@link
     * #parseShort(java.lang.String, int)} method.
     *
     * @param s a {@code String} containing the {@code short}
     *          representation to be parsed
     * @return  the {@code short} value represented by the
     *          argument in decimal.
     * @throws  NumberFormatException If the string does not
     *          contain a parsable {@code short}.
