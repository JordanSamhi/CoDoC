     * Flushes the stream.  If the stream has saved any characters from the
     * various write() methods in a buffer, write them immediately to their
     * intended destination.  Then, if that destination is another character or
     * byte stream, flush it.  Thus one flush() invocation will flush all the
     * buffers in a chain of Writers and OutputStreams.
     *
     * <p> If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided
     * by the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
     * stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
     * passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
     * they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.
