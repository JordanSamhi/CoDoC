     * Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
     * retaining the local date-time if possible.
     * <p>
     * This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
     * The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone,
     * determined using the same approach as
     * {@link #ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}.
     * <p>
     * To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
     * use {@link #withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)}.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param zone  the time-zone to change to, not null
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
