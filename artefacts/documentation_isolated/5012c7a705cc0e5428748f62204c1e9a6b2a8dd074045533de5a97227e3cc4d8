     * Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity)
     * {@code double} value that is greater than or equal to the
     * argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a
     * mathematical integer, then the result is the same as the
     * argument.  <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or
     * positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as
     * the argument.  <li>If the argument value is less than zero but
     * greater than -1.0, then the result is negative zero.</ul> Note
     * that the value of {@code StrictMath.ceil(x)} is exactly the
     * value of {@code -StrictMath.floor(-x)}.

     *          floating-point value that is greater than or equal to
     *          the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
