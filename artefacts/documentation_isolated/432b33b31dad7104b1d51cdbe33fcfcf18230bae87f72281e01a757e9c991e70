     * Returns a {@code Method} object that reflects the specified public
     * member method of the class or interface represented by this
     * {@code Class} object. The {@code name} parameter is a
     * {@code String} specifying the simple name of the desired method. The
     * {@code parameterTypes} parameter is an array of {@code Class}
     * objects that identify the method's formal parameter types, in declared
     * order. If {@code parameterTypes} is {@code null}, it is
     * treated as if it were an empty array.
     *
     * <p> If the {@code name} is "{@code <init>}" or "{@code <clinit>}" a
     * {@code NoSuchMethodException} is raised. Otherwise, the method to
     * be reflected is determined by the algorithm that follows.  Let C be the
     * class or interface represented by this object:
     * <OL>
     * <LI> C is searched for a <I>matching method</I>, as defined below. If a
     *      matching method is found, it is reflected.</LI>
     * <LI> If no matching method is found by step 1 then:
     *   <OL TYPE="a">
     *   <LI> If C is a class other than {@code Object}, then this algorithm is
     *        invoked recursively on the superclass of C.</LI>
     *   <LI> If C is the class {@code Object}, or if C is an interface, then
     *        the superinterfaces of C (if any) are searched for a matching
     *        method. If any such method is found, it is reflected.</LI>
     *   </OL></LI>
     * </OL>
     *
     * <p> To find a matching method in a class or interface C:&nbsp; If C
     * declares exactly one public method with the specified name and exactly
     * the same formal parameter types, that is the method reflected. If more
     * than one such method is found in C, and one of these methods has a
     * return type that is more specific than any of the others, that method is
     * reflected; otherwise one of the methods is chosen arbitrarily.
     *
     * <p>Note that there may be more than one matching method in a
     * class because while the Java language forbids a class to
     * declare multiple methods with the same signature but different
     * return types, the Java virtual machine does not.  This
     * increased flexibility in the virtual machine can be used to
     * implement various language features.  For example, covariant
     * returns can be implemented with {@linkplain
     * java.lang.reflect.Method#isBridge bridge methods}; the bridge
     * method and the method being overridden would have the same
     * signature but different return types.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an array type, then this
     * method does not find the {@code clone()} method.
     *
     * <p> Static methods declared in superinterfaces of the class or interface
     * represented by this {@code Class} object are not considered members of
     * the class or interface.
