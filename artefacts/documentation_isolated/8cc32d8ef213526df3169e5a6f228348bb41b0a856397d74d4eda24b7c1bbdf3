     * Sets the SO_SNDBUF option to the specified value for this
     * {@code DatagramSocket}. The SO_SNDBUF option is used by the
     * network implementation as a hint to size the underlying
     * network I/O buffers. The SO_SNDBUF setting may also be used
     * by the network implementation to determine the maximum size
     * of the packet that can be sent on this socket.
     * <p>
     * As SO_SNDBUF is a hint, applications that want to verify
     * what size the buffer is should call {@link #getSendBufferSize()}.
     * <p>
     * Increasing the buffer size may allow multiple outgoing packets
     * to be queued by the network implementation when the send rate
     * is high.
     * <p>
     * Note: If {@link #send(DatagramPacket)} is used to send a
     * {@code DatagramPacket} that is larger than the setting
     * of SO_SNDBUF then it is implementation specific if the
     * packet is sent or discarded.
     *
     * @param size the size to which to set the send buffer
     * size. This value must be greater than 0.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error
     * in the underlying protocol, such as an UDP error.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the value is 0 or is
     * negative.
