     * Read all lines from a file as a {@code Stream}. Unlike {@link
     * #readAllLines(Path, Charset) readAllLines}, this method does not read
     * all lines into a {@code List}, but instead populates lazily as the stream
     * is consumed.
     *
     * <p> Bytes from the file are decoded into characters using the specified
     * charset and the same line terminators as specified by {@code
     * readAllLines} are supported.
     *
     * <p> After this method returns, then any subsequent I/O exception that
     * occurs while reading from the file or when a malformed or unmappable byte
     * sequence is read, is wrapped in an {@link UncheckedIOException} that will
     * be thrown from the
     * {@link java.util.stream.Stream} method that caused the read to take
     * place. In case an {@code IOException} is thrown when closing the file,
     * it is also wrapped as an {@code UncheckedIOException}.
     *
     * <p> The returned stream encapsulates a {@link Reader}.  If timely
     * disposal of file system resources is required, the try-with-resources
     * construct should be used to ensure that the stream's
     * {@link Stream#close close} method is invoked after the stream operations
     * are completed.

     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   cs
     *          the charset to use for decoding
     *
     * @return  the lines from the file as a {@code Stream}
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs opening the file
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
