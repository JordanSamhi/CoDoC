     * Opens a file for reading, returning a {@code BufferedReader} to read text
     * from the file in an efficient manner. Bytes from the file are decoded into
     * characters using the {@link StandardCharsets#UTF_8 UTF-8} {@link Charset
     * charset}.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <pre>{@code
     * Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     *
     * @return  a new buffered reader, with default buffer size, to read text
     *          from the file
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs opening the file
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
