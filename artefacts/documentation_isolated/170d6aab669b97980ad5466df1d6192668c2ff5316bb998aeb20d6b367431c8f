     * Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a {@code BufferedWriter}
     * to write text to the file in an efficient manner. The text is encoded
     * into bytes for writing using the {@link StandardCharsets#UTF_8 UTF-8}
     * {@link Charset charset}.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <pre>{@code
     * Files.newBufferedWriter(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8, options)
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new buffered writer, with default buffer size, to write text
     *          to the file
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs opening or creating the file
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
