     * Sets the format to use for the format element with the given
     * format element index within the previously set pattern string.
     * The format element index is the zero-based number of the format
     * element counting from the start of the pattern string.
     * <p>
     * Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
     * changes during localization, it is generally better to use the
     * {@link #setFormatByArgumentIndex setFormatByArgumentIndex}
     * method, which accesses format elements based on the argument
     * index they specify.
     *
     * @param formatElementIndex the index of a format element within the pattern
     * @param newFormat the format to use for the specified format element
     * @exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if {@code formatElementIndex} is equal to or
     *            larger than the number of format elements in the pattern string
