     * Determines if this method handle
     * supports {@linkplain #asVarargsCollector variable arity} calls.
     * Such method handles arise from the following sources:
     * <ul>
     * <li>a call to {@linkplain #asVarargsCollector asVarargsCollector}
     * <li>a call to a {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup lookup method}
     *     which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor
     * <li>an {@code ldc} instruction of a {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle}
     *     which resolves to a variable arity Java method or constructor
     * </ul>
     * @return true if this method handle accepts more than one arity of plain, inexact {@code invoke} calls
     * @see #asVarargsCollector
     * @see #asFixedArity
