     * Binds a value {@code x} to the first argument of a method handle, without invoking it.
     * The new method handle adapts, as its <i>target</i>,
     * the current method handle by binding it to the given argument.
     * The type of the bound handle will be
     * the same as the type of the target, except that a single leading
     * reference parameter will be omitted.
     * <p>
     * When called, the bound handle inserts the given value {@code x}
     * as a new leading argument to the target.  The other arguments are
     * also passed unchanged.
     * What the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the bound handle.
     * <p>
     * The reference {@code x} must be convertible to the first parameter
     * type of the target.
     * <p>
     * (<em>Note:</em>  Because method handles are immutable, the target method handle
     * retains its original type and behavior.)
     * @param x  the value to bind to the first argument of the target
     * @return a new method handle which prepends the given value to the incoming
     *         argument list, before calling the original method handle
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the target does not have a
     *         leading parameter type that is a reference type
     * @throws ClassCastException if {@code x} cannot be converted
     *         to the leading parameter type of the target
