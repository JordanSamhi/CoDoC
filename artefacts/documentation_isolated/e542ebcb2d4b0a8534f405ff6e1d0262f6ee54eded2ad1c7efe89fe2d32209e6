     * Checks if the year is a leap year, as defined by the calendar system.
     * <p>
     * A leap-year is a year of a longer length than normal.
     * The exact meaning is determined by the chronology with the constraint that
     * a leap-year must imply a year-length longer than a non leap-year.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation uses {@link Chronology#isLeapYear(long)}.
     *
     * @return true if this date is in a leap year, false otherwise
