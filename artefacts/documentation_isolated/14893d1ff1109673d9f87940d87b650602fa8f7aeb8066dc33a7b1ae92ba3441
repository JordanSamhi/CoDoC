     * Sets the position of the animation to the specified point in time. This time should
     * be between 0 and the total duration of the animation, including any repetition. If
     * the animation has not yet been started, then it will not advance forward after it is
     * set to this time; it will simply set the time to this value and perform any appropriate
     * actions based on that time. If the animation is already running, then setCurrentPlayTime()
     * will set the current playing time to this value and continue playing from that point.
     *
     * @param playTime The time, in milliseconds, to which the animation is advanced or rewound.
