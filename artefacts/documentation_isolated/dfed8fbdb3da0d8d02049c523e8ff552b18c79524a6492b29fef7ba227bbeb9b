     * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the day-of-year altered.
     * <p>
     * This operates on the local time-line,
     * {@link LocalDateTime#withDayOfYear(int) changing the day-of-year} of the local date-time.
     * This is then converted back to a {@code ZonedDateTime}, using the zone ID
     * to obtain the offset.
     * <p>
     * When converting back to {@code ZonedDateTime}, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
     * then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
     * If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

     * @param dayOfYear  the day-of-year to set in the result, from 1 to 365-366
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date with the requested day, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the day-of-year value is invalid,
     *  or if the day-of-year is invalid for the year
