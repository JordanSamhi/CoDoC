     * Returns a sequential ordered {@code IntStream} from {@code startInclusive}
     * (inclusive) to {@code endInclusive} (inclusive) by an incremental step of
     * {@code 1}.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * <p>An equivalent sequence of increasing values can be produced
     * sequentially using a {@code for} loop as follows:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     for (int i = startInclusive; i <= endInclusive ; i++) { ... }
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param startInclusive the (inclusive) initial value
     * @param endInclusive the inclusive upper bound
     * @return a sequential {@code IntStream} for the range of {@code int}
     *         elements
