     * <p>
     * This parses the entire text producing a temporal object.
     * It is typically more useful to use {@link #parse(CharSequence, TemporalQuery)}.
     * The result of this method is {@code TemporalAccessor} which has been resolved,
     * applying basic validation checks to help ensure a valid date-time.
     * <p>
     * If the parse completes without reading the entire length of the text,
     * or a problem occurs during parsing or merging, then an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @param text  the text to parse, not null
     * @return the parsed temporal object, not null
     * @throws DateTimeParseException if unable to parse the requested result
