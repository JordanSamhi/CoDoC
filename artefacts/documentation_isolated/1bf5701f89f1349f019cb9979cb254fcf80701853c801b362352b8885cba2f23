     * Returns the common pool instance. This pool is statically
     * constructed; its run state is unaffected by attempts to {@link
     * #shutdown} or {@link #shutdownNow}. However this pool and any
     * ongoing processing are automatically terminated upon program
     * {@link System#exit}.  Any program that relies on asynchronous
     * task processing to complete before program termination should
     * invoke {@code commonPool().}{@link #awaitQuiescence awaitQuiescence},
     * before exit.
