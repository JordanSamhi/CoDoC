     * Checks if this date is after the specified date ignoring the chronology.
     * <p>
     * This method differs from the comparison in {@link #compareTo} in that it
     * only compares the underlying date and not the chronology.
     * This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
     * on the time-line position.
     * This is equivalent to using {@code date1.toEpochDay() > date2.toEpochDay()}.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day.
     *
     * @param other  the other date to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this is after the specified date
