     * Return a {@code Stream} that is lazily populated with {@code
     * Path} by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file.  The
     * file tree is traversed <em>depth-first</em>, the elements in the stream
     * are {@link Path} objects that are obtained as if by {@link
     * Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the relative path against {@code start}.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * walk(start, Integer.MAX_VALUE, options)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * In other words, it visits all levels of the file tree.
     *
     * <p> The returned stream encapsulates one or more {@link DirectoryStream}s.
     * If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the
     * {@code try}-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
     * stream's {@link Stream#close close} method is invoked after the stream
     * operations are completed.  Operating on a closed stream will result in an
     * {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.
     *
     * @param   start
     *          the starting file
     * @param   options
     *          options to configure the traversal
     *
     * @return  the {@link Stream} of {@link Path}
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
     *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead} method is invoked
     *          to check read access to the directory.
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
