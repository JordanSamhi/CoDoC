     * Ends an optional section.
     * <p>
     * The output of formatting can include optional sections, which may be nested.
     * An optional section is started by calling {@link #optionalStart()} and ended
     * using this method (or at the end of the builder).
     * <p>
     * Calling this method without having previously called {@code optionalStart}
     * will throw an exception.
     * Calling this method immediately after calling {@code optionalStart} has no effect
     * on the formatter other than ending the (empty) optional section.
     * <p>
     * All elements in the optional section are treated as optional.
     * During formatting, the section is only output if data is available in the
     * {@code TemporalAccessor} for all the elements in the section.
     * During parsing, the whole section may be missing from the parsed string.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a builder setup as
     * {@code builder.appendValue(HOUR_OF_DAY,2).optionalStart().appendValue(MINUTE_OF_HOUR,2).optionalEnd()}.
     * During formatting, the minute will only be output if its value can be obtained from the date-time.
     * During parsing, the input will be successfully parsed whether the minute is present or not.
     *
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
     * @throws IllegalStateException if there was no previous call to {@code optionalStart}
