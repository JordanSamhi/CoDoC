     * Subtracts this period from the specified temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
     * with this period subtracted.
     * If the temporal has a chronology, it must be the ISO chronology.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
     * {@link Temporal#minus(TemporalAmount)}.
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
     *   dateTime = thisPeriod.subtractFrom(dateTime);
     *   dateTime = dateTime.minus(thisPeriod);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The calculation operates as follows.
     * First, the chronology of the temporal is checked to ensure it is ISO chronology or null.
     * Second, if the months are zero, the years are subtracted if non-zero, otherwise
     * the combination of years and months is subtracted if non-zero.
     * Finally, any days are subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This approach ensures that a partial period can be subtracted from a partial date.
     * For example, a period of years and/or months can be subtracted from a {@code YearMonth},
     * but a period including days cannot.
     * The approach also subtracts years and months together when necessary, which ensures
     * correct behaviour at the end of the month.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
