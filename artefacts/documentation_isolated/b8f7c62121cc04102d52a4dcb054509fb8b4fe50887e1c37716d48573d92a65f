     * Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. The stream
     * will not be buffered, and is not required to support the {@link
     * InputStream#mark mark} or {@link InputStream#reset reset} methods. The
     * stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Reading
     * commences at the beginning of the file. Whether the returned stream is
     * <i>asynchronously closeable</i> and/or <i>interruptible</i> is highly
     * file system provider specific and therefore not specified.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * If no options are present then it is equivalent to opening the file with
     * the {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} option. In addition to the {@code
     * READ} option, an implementation may also support additional implementation
     * specific options.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new input stream
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if an invalid combination of options is specified
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
