     * Returns a stream producing the given {@code streamSize} number of
     * pseudorandom {@code double} values, each conforming to the given origin
     * (inclusive) and bound (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code double} value is generated as if it's the result
     * of calling the following method with the origin and bound:
     * <pre> {@code
     * double nextDouble(double origin, double bound) {
     *   double r = nextDouble();
     *   r = r * (bound - origin) + origin;
     *   if (r >= bound) // correct for rounding
     *     r = Math.nextDown(bound);
     *   return r;
     * }}</pre>
