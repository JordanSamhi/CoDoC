     * Returns a {@link Set} view of the mappings contained in this map.
     *
     * <p>The set's iterator returns the entries in ascending key order. The
     * sets's spliterator is
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>,
     * <em>fail-fast</em>, and additionally reports {@link Spliterator#SORTED} and
     * {@link Spliterator#ORDERED} with an encounter order that is ascending key
     * order.
     *
     * <p>The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
     * reflected in the set, and vice-versa.  If the map is modified
     * while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
     * the iterator's own {@code remove} operation, or through the
     * {@code setValue} operation on a map entry returned by the
     * iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined.  The set
     * supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
     * mapping from the map, via the {@code Iterator.remove},
     * {@code Set.remove}, {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll} and
     * {@code clear} operations.  It does not support the
     * {@code add} or {@code addAll} operations.
