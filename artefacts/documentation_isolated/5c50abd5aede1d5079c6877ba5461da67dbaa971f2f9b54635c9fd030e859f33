     * Sets the application restrictions for a given target application running in the calling user.
     * <p>
     * The caller must be a profile or device owner on that user, or the package allowed to manage
     * application restrictions via {@link #setDelegatedScopes} with the
     * {@link #DELEGATION_APP_RESTRICTIONS} scope; otherwise a security exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * The provided {@link Bundle} consists of key-value pairs, where the types of values may be:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code boolean}
     * <li>{@code int}
     * <li>{@code String} or {@code String[]}
     * <li>From {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M}, {@code Bundle} or {@code Bundle[]}
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If the restrictions are not available yet, but may be applied in the near future, the caller
     * can notify the target application of that by adding
     * {@link UserManager#KEY_RESTRICTIONS_PENDING} to the settings parameter.
     * <p>
     * The application restrictions are only made visible to the target application via
     * {@link UserManager#getApplicationRestrictions(String)}, in addition to the profile or device
     * owner, and the application restrictions managing package via
     * {@link #getApplicationRestrictions}.
     *
     * <p>NOTE: The method performs disk I/O and shouldn't be called on the main thread
     *
     * @param admin Which {@link DeviceAdminReceiver} this request is associated with, or
     *            {@code null} if called by the application restrictions managing package.
     * @param packageName The name of the package to update restricted settings for.
     * @param settings A {@link Bundle} to be parsed by the receiving application, conveying a new
     *            set of active restrictions.
     * @throws SecurityException if {@code admin} is not a device or profile owner.
