     * Returns a copy of this {@code LocalDate} with the specified number of months subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This method subtracts the specified amount from the months field in three steps:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Subtract the input months from the month-of-year field</li>
     * <li>Check if the resulting date would be invalid</li>
     * <li>Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * For example, 2007-03-31 minus one month would result in the invalid date
     * 2007-02-31. Instead of returning an invalid result, the last valid day
     * of the month, 2007-02-28, is selected instead.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param monthsToSubtract  the months to subtract, may be negative
     * @return a {@code LocalDate} based on this date with the months subtracted, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
