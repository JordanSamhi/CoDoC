     * Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted,
     * and failing if the given timeout elapses.  Implemented by first
     * checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once {@link
     * #tryAcquire}, returning on success.  Otherwise, the thread is
     * queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking
     * {@link #tryAcquire} until success or the thread is interrupted
     * or the timeout elapses.  This method can be used to implement
     * method {@link Lock#tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}.
     *
     * @param arg the acquire argument.  This value is conveyed to
     *        {@link #tryAcquire} but is otherwise uninterpreted and
     *        can represent anything you like.
     * @param nanosTimeout the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait
     * @return {@code true} if acquired; {@code false} if timed out
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
