     * Returns a {@code Type} object that represents the formal return
     * type of the method represented by this {@code Method} object.
     *
     * <p>If the return type is a parameterized type,
     * the {@code Type} object returned must accurately reflect
     * the actual type parameters used in the source code.
     *
     * <p>If the return type is a type variable or a parameterized type, it
     * is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.
