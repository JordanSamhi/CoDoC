     * A convenience method to set the owner's write permission for this abstract
     * pathname.
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method of the form <tt>file.setWritable(arg)</tt>
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     *
     * <pre>
     *     file.setWritable(arg, true) </pre>
     *
     * @param   writable
     *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow write
     *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow write operations
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded.  The
     *          operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
     *          change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the file
