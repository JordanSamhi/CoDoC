     * Gets the era applicable at this date.
     * <p>
     * The official ISO-8601 standard does not define eras, however {@code IsoChronology} does.
     * It defines two eras, 'CE' from year one onwards and 'BCE' from year zero backwards.
     * Since dates before the Julian-Gregorian cutover are not in line with history,
     * the cutover between 'BCE' and 'CE' is also not aligned with the commonly used
     * eras, often referred to using 'BC' and 'AD'.
     * <p>
     * Users of this class should typically ignore this method as it exists primarily
     * to fulfill the {@link ChronoLocalDate} contract where it is necessary to support
     * the Japanese calendar system.
     * <p>
     * The returned era will be a singleton capable of being compared with the constants
     * in {@link IsoChronology} using the {@code ==} operator.
     *
     * @return the {@code IsoChronology} era constant applicable at this date, not null
