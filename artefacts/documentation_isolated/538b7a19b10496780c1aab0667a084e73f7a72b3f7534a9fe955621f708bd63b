     * Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack.
     * If the object <tt>o</tt> occurs as an item in this stack, this
     * method returns the distance from the top of the stack of the
     * occurrence nearest the top of the stack; the topmost item on the
     * stack is considered to be at distance <tt>1</tt>. The <tt>equals</tt>

     * items in this stack.

     * @param   o   the desired object.
     * @return  the 1-based position from the top of the stack where
