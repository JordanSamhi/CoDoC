     * Compares two abstract pathnames lexicographically.  The ordering
     * defined by this method depends upon the underlying system.  On UNIX
     * systems, alphabetic case is significant in comparing pathnames; on Microsoft Windows
     * systems it is not.

     * @param   pathname  The abstract pathname to be compared to this abstract
     *                    pathname
     *
     * @return  Zero if the argument is equal to this abstract pathname, a
     *          value less than zero if this abstract pathname is
     *          lexicographically less than the argument, or a value greater
     *          than zero if this abstract pathname is lexicographically
     *          greater than the argument
