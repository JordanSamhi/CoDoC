     * Returns the result of invoking {@code toString()} on the destination
     * for the output.  For example, the following code formats text into a
     * {@link StringBuilder} then retrieves the resultant string:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *   Formatter f = new Formatter();
     *   f.format("Last reboot at %tc", lastRebootDate);
     *   String s = f.toString();
     *   // -&gt; s == "Last reboot at Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 PST 2000"
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same way as the
     * invocation
     *
     * <pre>
     *     out().toString() </pre>
     *
     * <p> Depending on the specification of {@code toString} for the {@link
     * Appendable}, the returned string may or may not contain the characters
     * written to the destination.  For instance, buffers typically return
     * their contents in {@code toString()}, but streams cannot since the
     * data is discarded.
     *
     * @return  The result of invoking {@code toString()} on the destination
     *          for the output
     *
     * @throws  FormatterClosedException
     *          If this formatter has been closed by invoking its {@link
     *          #close()} method
