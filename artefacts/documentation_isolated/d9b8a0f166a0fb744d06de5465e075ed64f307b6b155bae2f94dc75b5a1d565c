     * Gets the list of transition rules for years beyond those defined in the transition list.
     * <p>
     * The complete set of transitions for this rules instance is defined by this method
     * and {@link #getTransitions()}. This method returns instances of {@link ZoneOffsetTransitionRule}
     * that define an algorithm for when transitions will occur.
     * <p>
     * For any given {@code ZoneRules}, this list contains the transition rules for years
     * beyond those years that have been fully defined. These rules typically refer to future
     * daylight saving time rule changes.
     * <p>
     * If the zone defines daylight savings into the future, then the list will normally
     * be of size two and hold information about entering and exiting daylight savings.
     * If the zone does not have daylight savings, or information about future changes
     * is uncertain, then the list will be empty.
     * <p>
     * The list will be empty for fixed offset rules and for any time-zone where there is no
     * daylight saving time. The list will also be empty if the transition rules are unknown.
     *
     * @return an immutable list of transition rules, not null
