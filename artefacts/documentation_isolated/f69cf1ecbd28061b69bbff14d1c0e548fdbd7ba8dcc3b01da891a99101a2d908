     * Returns a string representation of the first argument as an
     * unsigned integer value in the radix specified by the second
     * argument.
     *
     * <p>If the radix is smaller than {@code Character.MIN_RADIX}
     * or larger than {@code Character.MAX_RADIX}, then the radix
     * {@code 10} is used instead.
     *
     * <p>Note that since the first argument is treated as an unsigned
     * value, no leading sign character is printed.
     *
     * <p>If the magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero
     * character {@code '0'} ({@code '\u005Cu0030'}); otherwise,
     * the first character of the representation of the magnitude will
     * not be the zero character.
     *
     * <p>The behavior of radixes and the characters used as digits
     * are the same as {@link #toString(int, int) toString}.
     *
     * @param   i       an integer to be converted to an unsigned string.
     * @param   radix   the radix to use in the string representation.
     * @return  an unsigned string representation of the argument in the specified radix.
     * @see     #toString(int, int)
     * @since 1.8
