     * Write the specified object to the ObjectOutputStream.  The class of the
     * object, the signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient
     * and non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are
     * written.  Default serialization for a class can be overridden using the
     * writeObject and the readObject methods.  Objects referenced by this
     * object are written transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of
     * objects can be reconstructed by an ObjectInputStream.
     *
     * <p>Exceptions are thrown for problems with the OutputStream and for
     * classes that should not be serialized.  All exceptions are fatal to the
     * OutputStream, which is left in an indeterminate state, and it is up to
     * the caller to ignore or recover the stream state.
     *
     * @throws  InvalidClassException Something is wrong with a class used by
     *          serialization.
     * @throws  NotSerializableException Some object to be serialized does not
     *          implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
     * @throws  IOException Any exception thrown by the underlying
     *          OutputStream.
