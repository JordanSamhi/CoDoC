     * Normalizes the time-zone ID, returning a {@code ZoneOffset} where possible.
     * <p>
     * The returns a normalized {@code ZoneId} that can be used in place of this ID.
     * The result will have {@code ZoneRules} equivalent to those returned by this object,
     * however the ID returned by {@code getId()} may be different.
     * <p>
     * The normalization checks if the rules of this {@code ZoneId} have a fixed offset.
     * If they do, then the {@code ZoneOffset} equal to that offset is returned.
     * Otherwise {@code this} is returned.
     *
     * @return the time-zone unique ID, not null
