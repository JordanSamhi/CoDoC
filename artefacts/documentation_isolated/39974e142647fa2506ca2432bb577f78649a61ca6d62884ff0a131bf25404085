     * Constructs a new {@code FileSystem} to access the contents of a file as a
     * file system.
     *
     * <p> This method is intended for specialized providers of pseudo file
     * systems where the contents of one or more files is treated as a file
     * system. The {@code env} parameter is a map of provider specific properties
     * to configure the file system.
     *
     * <p> If this provider does not support the creation of such file systems
     * or if the provider does not recognize the file type of the given file then
     * it throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. The default implementation
     * of this method throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          The path to the file
     * @param   env
     *          A map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
     *          may be empty
     *
     * @return  A new file system
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          If this provider does not support access to the contents as a
     *          file system or it does not recognize the file type of the
     *          given file
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          If the {@code env} parameter does not contain properties required
     *          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission.
