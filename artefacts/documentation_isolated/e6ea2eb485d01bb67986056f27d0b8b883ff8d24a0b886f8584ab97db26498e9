     * Returns a copy of this {@code LocalDateTime} with the specified number of days subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This method subtracts the specified amount from the days field decrementing the
     * month and year fields as necessary to ensure the result remains valid.
     * The result is only invalid if the maximum/minimum year is exceeded.
     * <p>
     * For example, 2009-01-01 minus one day would result in 2008-12-31.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param days  the days to subtract, may be negative
     * @return a {@code LocalDateTime} based on this date-time with the days subtracted, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
