     * Returns an iterator over the elements contained in this set
     * in the order in which these elements were added.
     *
     * <p>The returned iterator provides a snapshot of the state of the set
     * when the iterator was constructed. No synchronization is needed while
     * traversing the iterator. The iterator does <em>NOT</em> support the
     * {@code remove} method.
