     * Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
     * earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.
     * <p>
     * This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
     * at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
     * valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
     * a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.
     * <p>
     * If this method is called when it is not an overlap, {@code this}
     * is returned.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null
