     * Converts the given URI to a {@link Path} object.
     *
     * <p> This method iterates over the {@link FileSystemProvider#installedProviders()
     * installed} providers to locate the provider that is identified by the
     * URI {@link URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are
     * compared without regard to case. If the provider is found then its {@link
     * FileSystemProvider#getPath getPath} method is invoked to convert the
     * URI.
     *
     * <p> In the case of the default provider, identified by the URI scheme
     * "file", the given URI has a non-empty path component, and undefined query
     * and fragment components. Whether the authority component may be present
     * is platform specific. The returned {@code Path} is associated with the
     * {@link FileSystems#getDefault default} file system.
     *
     * <p> The default provider provides a similar <em>round-trip</em> guarantee
     * to the {@link java.io.File} class. For a given {@code Path} <i>p</i> it
     * is guaranteed that
     * <blockquote><tt>
     * Paths.get(</tt><i>p</i><tt>.{@link Path#toUri() toUri}()).equals(</tt>
     * <i>p</i><tt>.{@link Path#toAbsolutePath() toAbsolutePath}())</tt>
     * </blockquote>
     * so long as the original {@code Path}, the {@code URI}, and the new {@code
     * Path} are all created in (possibly different invocations of) the same
     * Java virtual machine. Whether other providers make any guarantees is
     * provider specific and therefore unspecified.
     *
     * @param   uri
     *          the URI to convert
     *
     * @return  the resulting {@code Path}
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if preconditions on the {@code uri} parameter do not hold. The
     *          format of the URI is provider specific.
     * @throws  FileSystemNotFoundException
     *          The file system, identified by the URI, does not exist and
     *          cannot be created automatically, or the provider identified by
     *          the URI's scheme component is not installed
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission to access the file system
