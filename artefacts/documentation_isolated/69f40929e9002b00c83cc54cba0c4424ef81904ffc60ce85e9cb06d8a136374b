     * <strong>Denigrated</strong>, use {@linkplain #getIssuer()} or
     * {@linkplain #getIssuerAsBytes()} instead. This method should not be
     * relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of
     * encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished
     * names.
     * <p>
     * Returns the issuer criterion as a {@code String}. This
     * distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509Certificate}. If {@code null}, the issuer criterion
     * is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will do.
     * <p>
     * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a
     * distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

     * @return the required issuer distinguished name in RFC 2253 format
     *         (or {@code null})
