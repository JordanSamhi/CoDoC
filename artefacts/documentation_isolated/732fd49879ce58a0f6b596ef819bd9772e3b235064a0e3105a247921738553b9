     * Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * This implementation returns a straightforward implementation of the
     * iterator interface, relying on the backing list's {@code size()},
     * {@code get(int)}, and {@code remove(int)} methods.
     *
     * <p>Note that the iterator returned by this method will throw an
     * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} in response to its
     * {@code remove} method unless the list's {@code remove(int)} method is
     * overridden.
     *
     * <p>This implementation can be made to throw runtime exceptions in the
     * face of concurrent modification, as described in the specification
     * for the (protected) {@link #modCount} field.
