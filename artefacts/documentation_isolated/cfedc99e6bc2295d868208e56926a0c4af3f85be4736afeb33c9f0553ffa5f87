         * Gets the name of the protection algorithm.
         * If none was set then the keystore provider will use its default
         * protection algorithm. The name of the default protection algorithm
         * for a given keystore type is set using the
         * {@code 'keystore.<type>.keyProtectionAlgorithm'} security property.
         * For example, the
         * {@code keystore.PKCS12.keyProtectionAlgorithm} property stores the
         * name of the default key protection algorithm used for PKCS12
         * keystores. If the security property is not set, an
         * implementation-specific algorithm will be used.
