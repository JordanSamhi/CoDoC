     * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
     * double} values, each conforming to the given origin (inclusive) and bound
     * (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code double} value is generated as if it's the result
     * of calling the following method with the origin and bound:
     * <pre> {@code
     * double nextDouble(double origin, double bound) {
     *   double r = nextDouble();
     *   r = r * (bound - origin) + origin;
     *   if (r >= bound) // correct for rounding
     *     r = Math.nextDown(bound);
     *   return r;
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @implNote This method is implemented to be equivalent to {@code
     * doubles(Long.MAX_VALUE, randomNumberOrigin, randomNumberBound)}.
     *
     * @param randomNumberOrigin the origin (inclusive) of each random value
     * @param randomNumberBound the bound (exclusive) of each random value
     * @return a stream of pseudorandom {@code double} values,
     *         each with the given origin (inclusive) and bound (exclusive)
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code randomNumberOrigin}
     *         is greater than or equal to {@code randomNumberBound}
