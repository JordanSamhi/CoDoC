     * Returns the class loader for the class.  Some implementations may use
     * null to represent the bootstrap class loader. This method will return
     * null in such implementations if this class was loaded by the bootstrap
     * class loader.
     *
     * <p> If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader is
     * not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of
     * the class loader for the class whose class loader is requested, then
     * this method calls the security manager's {@code checkPermission}
     * method with a {@code RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")}
     * permission to ensure it's ok to access the class loader for the class.
     *
     * <p>If this object
     * represents a primitive type or void, null is returned.

     * @return  the class loader that loaded the class or interface
     *          represented by this object.
     * @throws SecurityException
     *    if a security manager exists and its
     *    {@code checkPermission} method denies
     *    access to the class loader for the class.
