     * Creates a lazily concatenated stream whose elements are all the
     * elements of the first stream followed by all the elements of the
     * second stream.  The resulting stream is ordered if both
     * of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if either of the input
     * streams is parallel.  When the resulting stream is closed, the close
     * handlers for both input streams are invoked.
     *
     * @implNote
     * Use caution when constructing streams from repeated concatenation.
     * Accessing an element of a deeply concatenated stream can result in deep
     * call chains, or even {@code StackOverflowException}.
     *
     * @param a the first stream
     * @param b the second stream
     * @return the concatenation of the two input streams
