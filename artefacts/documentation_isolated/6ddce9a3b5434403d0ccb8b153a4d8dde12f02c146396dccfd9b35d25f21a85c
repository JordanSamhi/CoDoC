     * Returns the {@link FileStore} representing the file store where a file
     * is located.
     *
     * <p> Once a reference to the {@code FileStore} is obtained it is
     * implementation specific if operations on the returned {@code FileStore},
     * or {@link FileStoreAttributeView} objects obtained from it, continue
     * to depend on the existence of the file. In particular the behavior is not
     * defined for the case that the file is deleted or moved to a different
     * file store.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     *
     * @return  the file store where the file is stored
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file, and in
     *          addition it checks {@link RuntimePermission}<tt>
     *          ("getFileStoreAttributes")</tt>
