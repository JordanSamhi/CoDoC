     * <p>
     * This checks to see if this date-time represents a point on the
     * local time-line before the other date-time.
     * <pre>
     *   LocalDate a = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 6, 30, 12, 00);
     *   LocalDate b = LocalDateTime.of(2012, 7, 1, 12, 00);

     * <p>
     * This method only considers the position of the two date-times on the local time-line.
     * It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
     * This is different from the comparison in {@link #compareTo(ChronoLocalDateTime)},
     * but is the same approach as {@link ChronoLocalDateTime#timeLineOrder()}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this date-time is before the specified date-time
