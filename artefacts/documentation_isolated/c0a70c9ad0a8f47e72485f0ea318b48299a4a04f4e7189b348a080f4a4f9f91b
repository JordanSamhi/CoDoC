     * Executes {@code command} with zero required delay.
     * This has effect equivalent to
     * {@link #schedule(Runnable,long,TimeUnit) schedule(command, 0, anyUnit)}.
     * Note that inspections of the queue and of the list returned by
     * {@code shutdownNow} will access the zero-delayed
     * {@link ScheduledFuture}, not the {@code command} itself.
     *
     * <p>A consequence of the use of {@code ScheduledFuture} objects is
     * that {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#afterExecute afterExecute} is always
     * called with a null second {@code Throwable} argument, even if the
     * {@code command} terminated abruptly.  Instead, the {@code Throwable}
     * thrown by such a task can be obtained via {@link Future#get}.
     *
     * @throws RejectedExecutionException at discretion of
     *         {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}, if the task
     *         cannot be accepted for execution because the
     *         executor has been shut down
     * @throws NullPointerException {@inheritDoc}
