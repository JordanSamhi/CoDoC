     * Sets the day of the month of this <tt>Date</tt> object to the
     * specified value. This <tt>Date</tt> object is modified so that
     * it represents a point in time within the specified day of the
     * month, with the year, month, hour, minute, and second the same
     * as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. If the date
     * was April 30, for example, and the date is set to 31, then it
     * will be treated as if it were on May 1, because April has only
     * 30 days.

     * @param   date   the day of the month value between 1-31.
