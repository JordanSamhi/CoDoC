     * Sets performance preferences for this ServerSocket.
     *
     * <p> Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default.  Some implementations
     * may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
     * characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to
     * express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
     * when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.
     *
     * <p> Performance preferences are described by three integers
     * whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
     * low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers
     * are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
     * compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences.  If the
     * application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
     * bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
     * {@code (1, 0, 0)}.  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
     * latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
     * invoke this method with the values {@code (0, 1, 2)}.
     *
     * <p> Invoking this method after this socket has been bound
     * will have no effect. This implies that in order to use this capability
     * requires the socket to be created with the no-argument constructor.
