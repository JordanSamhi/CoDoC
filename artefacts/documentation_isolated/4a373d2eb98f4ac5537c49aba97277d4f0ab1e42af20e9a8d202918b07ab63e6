     * Reads up to <code>byte.length</code> bytes of data from this
     * input stream into an array of bytes. This method blocks until some
     * input is available.
     * <p>
     * This method simply performs the call
     * <code>read(b, 0, b.length)</code> and returns
     * the  result. It is important that it does
     * <i>not</i> do <code>in.read(b)</code> instead;
     * certain subclasses of  <code>FilterInputStream</code>
     * depend on the implementation strategy actually
     * used.
     *
     * @param      b   the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
     *             <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end of
     *             the stream has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     * @see        java.io.FilterInputStream#read(byte[], int, int)
