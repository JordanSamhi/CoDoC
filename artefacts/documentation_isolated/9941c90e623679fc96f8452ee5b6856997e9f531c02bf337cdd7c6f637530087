     * Returns true if this format will parse numbers as integers only.
     * For example in the English locale, with ParseIntegerOnly true, the
     * string "1234." would be parsed as the integer value 1234 and parsing
     * would stop at the "." character.  Of course, the exact format accepted
     * by the parse operation is locale dependant and determined by sub-classes
     * of NumberFormat.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if numbers should be parsed as integers only;
     *         {@code false} otherwise
