     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified navigable set.
     * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an
     * immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a navigable set
     * contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a
     * dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent
     * access to the navigable set takes place through the view, it is
     * <em>guaranteed</em> that the navigable set cannot contain an incorrectly
     * typed element.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
     * checkedCollection} method.
     *
     * <p>The returned navigable set will be serializable if the specified
     * navigable set is serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned navigable set permits insertion of null elements
     * whenever the backing sorted set does.
     *
     * @param <E> the class of the objects in the set

     *          returned
