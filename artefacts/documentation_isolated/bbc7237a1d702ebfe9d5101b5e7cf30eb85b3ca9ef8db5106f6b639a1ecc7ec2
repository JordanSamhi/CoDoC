     * Sets the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the
     * {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
     * distinguished names. If {@code null}, any issuer distinguished name
     * will do.
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
     * the complete set of issuer names which {@code X509CRLs} may contain.
     * The specified value replaces the previous value for the issuerNames
     * criterion.
     * <p>
     * The {@code names} parameter (if not {@code null}) is a
     * {@code Collection} of {@code X500Principal}s.
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code names} parameter can contain duplicate
     * distinguished names, but they may be removed from the
     * {@code Collection} of names returned by the
     * {@link #getIssuers getIssuers} method.
     * <p>
     * Note that a copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
     * protect against subsequent modifications.
