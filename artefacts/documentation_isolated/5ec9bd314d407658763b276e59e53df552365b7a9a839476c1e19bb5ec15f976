     * Changes the parse style to be case sensitive for the remainder of the formatter.
     * <p>
     * Parsing can be case sensitive or insensitive - by default it is case sensitive.
     * This method allows the case sensitivity setting of parsing to be changed.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method changes the state of the builder such that all
     * subsequent builder method calls will parse text in case sensitive mode.
     * See {@link #parseCaseInsensitive} for the opposite setting.
     * The parse case sensitive/insensitive methods may be called at any point
     * in the builder, thus the parser can swap between case parsing modes
     * multiple times during the parse.
     * <p>
     * Since the default is case sensitive, this method should only be used after
     * a previous call to {@code #parseCaseInsensitive}.
     *
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
