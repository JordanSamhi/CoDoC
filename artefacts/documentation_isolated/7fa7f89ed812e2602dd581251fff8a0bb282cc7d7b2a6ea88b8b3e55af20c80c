     * Compresses the input data and fills specified buffer with compressed
     * data. Returns actual number of bytes of compressed data. A return value
     * of 0 indicates that {@link #needsInput() needsInput} should be called
     * in order to determine if more input data is required.
     *
     * <p>This method uses {@link #NO_FLUSH} as its compression flush mode.
     * An invocation of this method of the form {@code deflater.deflate(b, off, len)}
     * yields the same result as the invocation of
     * {@code deflater.deflate(b, off, len, Deflater.NO_FLUSH)}.
     *
     * @param b the buffer for the compressed data
     * @param off the start offset of the data
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes of compressed data
     * @return the actual number of bytes of compressed data written to the
     *         output buffer
