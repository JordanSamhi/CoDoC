     * Formats an array of objects and inserts them into the
     * <code>MessageFormat</code>'s pattern, producing an
     * <code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code>.
     * You can use the returned <code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code>
     * to build the resulting String, as well as to determine information
     * about the resulting String.
     * <p>
     * The text of the returned <code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code> is
     * the same that would be returned by
     * <blockquote>
     *     <code>{@link #format(java.lang.Object[], java.lang.StringBuffer, java.text.FieldPosition) format}(arguments, new StringBuffer(), null).toString()</code>
     * </blockquote>
     * <p>
     * In addition, the <code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code> contains at
     * least attributes indicating where text was generated from an
     * argument in the <code>arguments</code> array. The keys of these attributes are of
     * type <code>MessageFormat.Field</code>, their values are
     * <code>Integer</code> objects indicating the index in the <code>arguments</code>
     * array of the argument from which the text was generated.
     * <p>
     * The attributes/value from the underlying <code>Format</code>
     * instances that <code>MessageFormat</code> uses will also be
     * placed in the resulting <code>AttributedCharacterIterator</code>.
     * This allows you to not only find where an argument is placed in the
     * resulting String, but also which fields it contains in turn.
     *
     * @param arguments an array of objects to be formatted and substituted.
     * @return AttributedCharacterIterator describing the formatted value.
     * @exception NullPointerException if <code>arguments</code> is null.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if an argument in the
     *            <code>arguments</code> array is not of the type
     *            expected by the format element(s) that use it.
