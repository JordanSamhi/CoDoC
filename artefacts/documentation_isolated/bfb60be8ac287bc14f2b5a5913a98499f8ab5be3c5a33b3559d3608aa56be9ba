     * Tells whether or not a file is considered <em>hidden</em>. The exact
     * definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
     * example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
     * period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
     * isn't a directory and the DOS {@link DosFileAttributes#isHidden hidden}
     * attribute is set.
     *
     * <p> Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
     * the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to test
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file is considered hidden
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
