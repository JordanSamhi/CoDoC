     * Writes <code>b.length</code> bytes from the specified byte array
     * to this output stream. The general contract for <code>write(b)</code>
     * is that it should have exactly the same effect as the call
     * <code>write(b, 0, b.length)</code>.
     *
     * @param      b   the data.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     * @see        java.io.OutputStream#write(byte[], int, int)
