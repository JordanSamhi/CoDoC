     * Returns the hashcode for this certification path. The hash code of
     * a certification path is defined to be the result of the following
     * calculation:
     * <pre>{@code
     *  hashCode = path.getType().hashCode();
     *  hashCode = 31*hashCode + path.getCertificates().hashCode();
     * }</pre>
     * This ensures that {@code path1.equals(path2)} implies that
     * {@code path1.hashCode()==path2.hashCode()} for any two certification
     * paths, {@code path1} and {@code path2}, as required by the
     * general contract of {@code Object.hashCode}.
     *
     * @return the hashcode value for this certification path
