     * Queries the number of holds on this lock by the current thread.
     *
     * <p>A thread has a hold on a lock for each lock action that is not
     * matched by an unlock action.
     *
     * <p>The hold count information is typically only used for testing and
     * debugging purposes. For example, if a certain section of code should
     * not be entered with the lock already held then we can assert that
     * fact:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * class X {
     *   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
     *   // ...
     *   public void m() {
     *     assert lock.getHoldCount() == 0;
     *     lock.lock();
     *     try {
     *       // ... method body
     *     } finally {
     *       lock.unlock();
     *     }
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @return the number of holds on this lock by the current thread,
     *         or zero if this lock is not held by the current thread
