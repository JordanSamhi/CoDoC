     * alias.
     *
     * <p>If the protected key is of type
     * {@code java.security.PrivateKey}, it must be accompanied by a
     * certificate chain certifying the corresponding public key. If the
     * underlying keystore implementation is of type {@code jks},
     * {@code key} must be encoded as an
     * {@code EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo} as defined in the PKCS #8 standard.
     *
     * <p>If the given alias already exists, the keystore information
     * associated with it is overridden by the given key (and possibly
     * certificate chain).
     *
     * @param alias the alias name
     * @param key the key (in protected format) to be associated with the alias
     * @param chain the certificate chain for the corresponding public

     * @exception KeyStoreException if the keystore has not been initialized
     * (loaded), or if this operation fails for some other reason.
