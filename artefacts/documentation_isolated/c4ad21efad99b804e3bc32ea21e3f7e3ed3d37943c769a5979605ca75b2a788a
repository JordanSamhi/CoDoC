     * Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"
     * in this tokenizer. It removes any special significance the
     * character has as a comment character, word component, string
     * delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
     * is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
     * single-character token and sets {@code ttype} field to the
     * character value.
     *
     * <p>Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
     * with the ability of a {@code StreamTokenizer} to count
     * lines. The {@code lineno} method may no longer reflect
     * the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.
     *
     * @param   ch   the character.
