     * Increases the capacity of this vector, if necessary, to ensure
     * that it can hold at least the number of components specified by
     * the minimum capacity argument.
     *
     * <p>If the current capacity of this vector is less than
     * {@code minCapacity}, then its capacity is increased by replacing its
     * internal data array, kept in the field {@code elementData}, with a
     * larger one.  The size of the new data array will be the old size plus
     * {@code capacityIncrement}, unless the value of
     * {@code capacityIncrement} is less than or equal to zero, in which case
     * the new capacity will be twice the old capacity; but if this new size
     * is still smaller than {@code minCapacity}, then the new capacity will
     * be {@code minCapacity}.
     *
     * @param minCapacity the desired minimum capacity
