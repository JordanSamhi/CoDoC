     * This method tells the object to use appropriate information to extract
     * starting values for the animation. For example, a AnimatorSet object will pass
     * this call to its child objects to tell them to set up the values. A
     * ObjectAnimator object will use the information it has about its target object
     * and PropertyValuesHolder objects to get the start values for its properties.
     * A ValueAnimator object will ignore the request since it does not have enough
     * information (such as a target object) to gather these values.
