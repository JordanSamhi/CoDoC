     * Adds a new provider, at a specified position. The position is
     * the preference order in which providers are searched for
     * requested algorithms.  The position is 1-based, that is,
     * 1 is most preferred, followed by 2, and so on.
     *
     * <p>If the given provider is installed at the requested position,
     * the provider that used to be at that position, and all providers
     * with a position greater than {@code position}, are shifted up
     * one position (towards the end of the list of installed providers).
     *
     * <p>A provider cannot be added if it is already installed.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, the
     * {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkSecurityAccess} method is called
     * with the {@code "insertProvider"} permission target name to see if
     * it's ok to add a new provider. If this permission check is denied,
     * {@code checkSecurityAccess} is called again with the
     * {@code "insertProvider."+provider.getName()} permission target name. If
     * both checks are denied, a {@code SecurityException} is thrown.
     *
     * @param provider the provider to be added.
     *
     * @param position the preference position that the caller would
     * like for this provider.
     *
     * @return the actual preference position in which the provider was
     * added, or -1 if the provider was not added because it is
     * already installed.
     *
     * @throws  NullPointerException if provider is null
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager exists and its {@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkSecurityAccess} method
     *          denies access to add a new provider
