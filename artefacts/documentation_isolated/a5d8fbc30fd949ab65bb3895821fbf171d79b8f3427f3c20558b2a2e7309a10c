     * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDateTime}, based on this one, with the value
     * for the specified field changed.
     * This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
     * If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
     * some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
     * such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
     * In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
     * the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
     * The {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will behave as per
     * the matching method on {@link LocalDate#with(TemporalField, long) LocalDate}
     * or {@link LocalTime#with(TemporalField, long) LocalTime}.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the field determines
     * whether and how to adjust the instant.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
