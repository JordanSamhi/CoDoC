     * Resolves parsed {@code ChronoField} values into a date during parsing.
     * <p>
     * Most {@code TemporalField} implementations are resolved using the
     * resolve method on the field. By contrast, the {@code ChronoField} class
     * defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology.
     * As such, {@code ChronoField} date fields are resolved here in the
     * context of a specific chronology.
     * <p>
     * {@code ChronoField} instances on the ISO calendar system are resolved
     * as follows.
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code EPOCH_DAY} - If present, this is converted to a {@code LocalDate}
     *  and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
     * <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} - If present, then it is split into the
     *  {@code YEAR} and {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}. If the mode is strict or smart
     *  then the field is validated.
     * <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} and {@code ERA} - If both are present, then they
     *  are combined to form a {@code YEAR}. In lenient mode, the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA}
     *  range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The {@code ERA} is
     *  validated for range in all three modes. If only the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *  present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the current era (CE/AD)
     *  is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *  left untouched. If only the {@code ERA} is present, then it is left untouched.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     *  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated. If the mode is smart or strict,
     *  then the month and day are validated, with the day validated from 1 to 31.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in months, then the difference in days.
     *  If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
     *  the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
     *  If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
     * <li>{@code YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
     *  If both are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in days.
     *  If the mode is smart or strict, then the two fields must form a valid date.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *  {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH} -
     *  If all four are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
     *  If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
     *  their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
     *  the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     *  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
     *  did not change the month.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *  {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} - If all four are present, then they are combined to
     *  form a {@code LocalDate}. The approach is the same as described above for
     *  years, months and weeks in {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH}.
     *  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once
     *  the years, months and weeks have been handled.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} and {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR} -
     *  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in weeks, then in days.
     *  If the mode is smart or strict, then the all three fields are validated to
     *  their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
     *  the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     *  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
     *  did not change the year.
     * <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} -
     *  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  The approach is the same as described above for years and weeks in
     *  {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR}. The day-of-week is adjusted as the
     *  next or same matching day-of-week once the years and weeks have been handled.
