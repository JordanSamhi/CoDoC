     * Copy a file to a target file.
     *
     * <p> This method copies a file to the target file with the {@code
     * options} parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
     * copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
     * except if the source and target are the {@link #isSameFile same} file, in
     * which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
     * are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
     * supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
     * link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
     * directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
     * copied). This method can be used with the {@link #walkFileTree
     * walkFileTree} method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
     * or an entire <i>file-tree</i> where required.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter may include any of the following:
     *
     * <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="">
     * <tr> <th>Option</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@link StandardCopyOption#REPLACE_EXISTING REPLACE_EXISTING} </td>
     *   <td> If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
     *     is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
     *     symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
     *     the link, is replaced. </td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@link StandardCopyOption#COPY_ATTRIBUTES COPY_ATTRIBUTES} </td>
     *   <td> Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
     *     the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
     *     and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the
     *     {@link BasicFileAttributes#lastModifiedTime last-modified-time} is
     *     copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
     *     file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
     *     loss. </td>
     * </tr>
     * <tr>
     *   <td> {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS NOFOLLOW_LINKS} </td>
     *   <td> Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
     *     then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
     *     It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
     *     new link. In other words, the {@code COPY_ATTRIBUTES} option may be
     *     ignored when copying a symbolic link. </td>
     * </tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * <p> An implementation of this interface may support additional
     * implementation specific options.
     *
     * <p> Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an {@link IOException}
     * is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
     * of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
     * the {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified and the target file
     * exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
     * the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
     * to other file system activities.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
     * Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
     * name as the source file:
     * <pre>
     *     Path source = ...
     *     Path newdir = ...
     *     Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   source
     *          the path to the file to copy
     * @param   target
     *          the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
     *          provider to the source path)
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the copy should be done
     *
     * @return  the path to the target file
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the
     *          {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is not specified <i>(optional
     *          specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  DirectoryNotEmptyException
     *          the {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified but the file
     *          cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory
     *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the
     *          {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite} is invoked
     *          to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
     *          copied the security manager is invoked to check {@link
     *          LinkPermission}{@code ("symbolic")}.
