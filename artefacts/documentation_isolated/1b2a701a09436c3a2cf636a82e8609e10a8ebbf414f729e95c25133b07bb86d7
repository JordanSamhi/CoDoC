     * Returns a file's POSIX file permissions.
     *
     * <p> The {@code path} parameter is associated with a {@code FileSystem}
     * that supports the {@link PosixFileAttributeView}. This attribute view
     * provides access to file attributes commonly associated with files on file
     * systems used by operating systems that implement the Portable Operating
     * System Interface (POSIX) family of standards.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
     * symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
     * of the link is read. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS
     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   options
     *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
     *
     * @return  the file permissions
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the associated file system does not support the {@code
     *          PosixFileAttributeView}
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, a security manager is
     *          installed, and it denies {@link RuntimePermission}<tt>("accessUserInformation")</tt>
     *          or its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead} method
     *          denies read access to the file.
