     * Indicates that all elements have been pushed.  If the {@code Sink} is
     * stateful, it should send any stored state downstream at this time, and
     * should clear any accumulated state (and associated resources).
     *
     * <p>Prior to this call, the sink must be in the active state, and after
     * this call it is returned to the initial state.
