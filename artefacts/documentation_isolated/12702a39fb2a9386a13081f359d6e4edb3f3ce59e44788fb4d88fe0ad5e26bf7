     * Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
     * current task is running in, if applicable, or using the {@link
     * ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} if not {@link #inForkJoinPool}.  While
     * it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
     * task more than once unless it has completed and been
     * reinitialized.  Subsequent modifications to the state of this
     * task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
     * consistently observable by any thread other than the one
     * executing it unless preceded by a call to {@link #join} or
     * related methods, or a call to {@link #isDone} returning {@code
     * true}.
