     * Returns a {@link java.net.URLConnection URLConnection} instance that
     * represents a connection to the remote object referred to by the
     * {@code URL}.
     *
     * <P>A new instance of {@linkplain java.net.URLConnection URLConnection} is
     * created every time when invoking the
     * {@linkplain java.net.URLStreamHandler#openConnection(URL)
     * URLStreamHandler.openConnection(URL)} method of the protocol handler for
     * this URL.</P>
     *
     * <P>It should be noted that a URLConnection instance does not establish
     * the actual network connection on creation. This will happen only when
     * calling {@linkplain java.net.URLConnection#connect() URLConnection.connect()}.</P>
     *
     * <P>If for the URL's protocol (such as HTTP or JAR), there
     * exists a public, specialized URLConnection subclass belonging
     * to one of the following packages or one of their subpackages:
     * java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.net, the connection
     * returned will be of that subclass. For example, for HTTP an
     * HttpURLConnection will be returned, and for JAR a
     * JarURLConnection will be returned.</P>
     *
     * @return     a {@link java.net.URLConnection URLConnection} linking
     *             to the URL.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O exception occurs.
     * @see        java.net.URL#URL(java.lang.String, java.lang.String,
