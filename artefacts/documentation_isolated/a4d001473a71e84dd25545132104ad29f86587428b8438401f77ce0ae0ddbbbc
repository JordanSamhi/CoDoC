    * Closes this URLClassLoader, so that it can no longer be used to load
    * new classes or resources that are defined by this loader.
    * Classes and resources defined by any of this loader's parents in the
    * delegation hierarchy are still accessible. Also, any classes or resources
    * that are already loaded, are still accessible.
    * <p>
    * In the case of jar: and file: URLs, it also closes any files
    * that were opened by it. If another thread is loading a
    * class when the {@code close} method is invoked, then the result of
    * that load is undefined.
    * <p>
    * The method makes a best effort attempt to close all opened files,
    * by catching {@link IOException}s internally. Unchecked exceptions
    * and errors are not caught. Calling close on an already closed
    * loader has no effect.
    * <p>
    * @exception IOException if closing any file opened by this class loader
    * resulted in an IOException. Any such exceptions are caught internally.
    * If only one is caught, then it is re-thrown. If more than one exception
    * is caught, then the second and following exceptions are added
    * as suppressed exceptions of the first one caught, which is then re-thrown.
    *
    * @exception SecurityException if a security manager is set, and it denies
    *   {@link RuntimePermission}{@code ("closeClassLoader")}
