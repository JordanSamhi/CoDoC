     * Returns <tt>true</tt> if the two specified arrays of doubles are
     * <i>equal</i> to one another.  Two arrays are considered equal if both
     * arrays contain the same number of elements, and all corresponding pairs
     * of elements in the two arrays are equal.  In other words, two arrays
     * are equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.  Also,
     * two array references are considered equal if both are <tt>null</tt>.<p>
     *
     * Two doubles <tt>d1</tt> and <tt>d2</tt> are considered equal if:
     * <pre>    <tt>new Double(d1).equals(new Double(d2))</tt></pre>
     * (Unlike the <tt>==</tt> operator, this method considers
     * <tt>NaN</tt> equals to itself, and 0.0d unequal to -0.0d.)
     *
     * @param a one array to be tested for equality
     * @param a2 the other array to be tested for equality
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the two arrays are equal
     * @see Double#equals(Object)
