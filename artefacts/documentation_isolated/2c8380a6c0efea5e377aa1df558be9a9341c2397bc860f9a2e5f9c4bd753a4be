     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZoneId} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a zone based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code ZoneId}.
     * <p>
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents some form of date and time information.
     * This factory converts the arbitrary temporal object to an instance of {@code ZoneId}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion will try to obtain the zone in a way that favours region-based
     * zones over offset-based zones using {@link TemporalQueries#zone()}.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code ZoneId::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the zone ID, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code ZoneId}
