     * Determines whether or not ends of line are treated as tokens.
     * If the flag argument is true, this tokenizer treats end of lines
     * as tokens; the {@code nextToken} method returns
     * {@code TT_EOL} and also sets the {@code ttype} field to
     * this value when an end of line is read.
     * <p>
     * A line is a sequence of characters ending with either a
     * carriage-return character ({@code '\u005Cr'}) or a newline
     * character ({@code '\u005Cn'}). In addition, a carriage-return
     * character followed immediately by a newline character is treated
     * as a single end-of-line token.
     * <p>
     * If the {@code flag} is false, end-of-line characters are
     * treated as white space and serve only to separate tokens.
     *
     * @param   flag   {@code true} indicates that end-of-line characters
     *                 are separate tokens; {@code false} indicates that
     *                 end-of-line characters are white space.
