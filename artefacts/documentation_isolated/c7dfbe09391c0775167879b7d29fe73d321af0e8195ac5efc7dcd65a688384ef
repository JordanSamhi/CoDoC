     * Opens a datagram channel.
     *
     * <p> The new channel is created by invoking the {@link
     * java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider#openDatagramChannel()
     * openDatagramChannel} method of the system-wide default {@link
     * java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider} object.  The channel will not be
     * connected.
     *
     * <p> The {@link ProtocolFamily ProtocolFamily} of the channel's socket
     * is platform (and possibly configuration) dependent and therefore unspecified.
     * The {@link #open(ProtocolFamily) open} allows the protocol family to be
     * selected when opening a datagram channel, and should be used to open
     * datagram channels that are intended for Internet Protocol multicasting.
