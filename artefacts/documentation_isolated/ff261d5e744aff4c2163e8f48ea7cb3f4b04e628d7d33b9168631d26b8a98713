     * Calling the <code>gc</code> method suggests that the Java Virtual
     * Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
     * make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
     * When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
     * Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
     * objects.

     * The call <code>System.gc()</code> is effectively equivalent to the
     * call:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @see     java.lang.Runtime#gc()
