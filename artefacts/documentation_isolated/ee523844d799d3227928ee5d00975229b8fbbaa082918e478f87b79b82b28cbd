     * The protocol handler calls this method after a resource has
     * been retrieved, and the ResponseCache must decide whether or
     * not to store the resource in its cache. If the resource is to
     * be cached, then put() must return a CacheRequest object which
     * contains an OutputStream that the protocol handler will
     * use to write the resource into the cache. If the resource is
     * not to be cached, then put must return null.
     *
     * @param uri a {@code URI} used to reference the requested
     *            network resource
     * @param conn - a URLConnection instance that is used to fetch
     *            the response to be cached
     * @return a {@code CacheRequest} for recording the
     *            response to be cached. Null return indicates that
     *            the caller does not intend to cache the response.
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any one of the arguments is
     *            null
