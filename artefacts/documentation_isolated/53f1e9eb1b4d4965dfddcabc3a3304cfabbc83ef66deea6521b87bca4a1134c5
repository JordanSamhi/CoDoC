     * Initializes the <i>cause</i> of this throwable to the specified value.
     * (The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown.)
     *
     * <p>This method can be called at most once.  It is generally called from
     * within the constructor, or immediately after creating the
     * throwable.  If this throwable was created
     * with {@link #Throwable(Throwable)} or
     * {@link #Throwable(String,Throwable)}, this method cannot be called
     * even once.
     *
     * <p>An example of using this method on a legacy throwable type
     * without other support for setting the cause is:
     *
     * <pre>
     * try {
     *     lowLevelOp();
     * } catch (LowLevelException le) {
     *     throw (HighLevelException)
     *           new HighLevelException().initCause(le); // Legacy constructor
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param  cause the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
     *         {@link #getCause()} method).  (A {@code null} value is
     *         permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
     *         unknown.)
     * @return  a reference to this {@code Throwable} instance.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code cause} is this
     *         throwable.  (A throwable cannot be its own cause.)
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this throwable was
     *         created with {@link #Throwable(Throwable)} or
     *         {@link #Throwable(String,Throwable)}, or this method has already
     *         been called on this throwable.
     * @since  1.4
