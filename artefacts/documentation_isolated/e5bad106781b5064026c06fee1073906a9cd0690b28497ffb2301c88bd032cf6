     * Gets an immutable collection of issuer alternative names from the
     * {@code IssuerAltName} extension, (OID = 2.5.29.18).
     * <p>
     * The ASN.1 definition of the {@code IssuerAltName} extension is:
     * <pre>
     * IssuerAltName ::= GeneralNames
     * </pre>
     * The ASN.1 definition of {@code GeneralNames} is defined
     * in {@link #getSubjectAlternativeNames getSubjectAlternativeNames}.
     * <p>
     * If this certificate does not contain an {@code IssuerAltName}
     * extension, {@code null} is returned. Otherwise, a
     * {@code Collection} is returned with an entry representing each
     * {@code GeneralName} included in the extension. Each entry is a
     * {@code List} whose first entry is an {@code Integer}
     * (the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a {@code String}
     * or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form,
     * respectively). For more details about the formats used for each
     * name type, see the {@code getSubjectAlternativeNames} method.
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code Collection} returned may contain more
     * than one name of the same type. Also, note that the returned
     * {@code Collection} is immutable and any entries containing byte
     * arrays are cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.
     * <p>
     * This method was added to version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform Standard
     * Edition. In order to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
     * service providers, this method is not {@code abstract}
     * and it provides a default implementation. Subclasses
     * should override this method with a correct implementation.
     *
     * @return an immutable {@code Collection} of issuer alternative

     * @throws CertificateParsingException if the extension cannot be decoded
     * @since 1.4
