     * Appends the value of a date-time field to the formatter using a fixed
     * width, zero-padded approach.
     * <p>
     * The value of the field will be output during a format.
     * If the value cannot be obtained then an exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * The value will be zero-padded on the left. If the size of the value
     * means that it cannot be printed within the width then an exception is thrown.
     * If the value of the field is negative then an exception is thrown during formatting.
     * <p>
     * This method supports a special technique of parsing known as 'adjacent value parsing'.
     * This technique solves the problem where a value, variable or fixed width, is followed by one or more
     * fixed length values. The standard parser is greedy, and thus it would normally
     * steal the digits that are needed by the fixed width value parsers that follow the
     * variable width one.
     * <p>
     * No action is required to initiate 'adjacent value parsing'.
     * When a call to {@code appendValue} is made, the builder
     * enters adjacent value parsing setup mode. If the immediately subsequent method
     * call or calls on the same builder are for a fixed width value, then the parser will reserve
     * space so that the fixed width values can be parsed.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider {@code builder.appendValue(YEAR).appendValue(MONTH_OF_YEAR, 2);}
     * The year is a variable width parse of between 1 and 19 digits.
     * The month is a fixed width parse of 2 digits.
     * Because these were appended to the same builder immediately after one another,
     * the year parser will reserve two digits for the month to parse.
     * Thus, the text '201106' will correctly parse to a year of 2011 and a month of 6.
     * Without adjacent value parsing, the year would greedily parse all six digits and leave
     * nothing for the month.
     * <p>
     * Adjacent value parsing applies to each set of fixed width not-negative values in the parser
     * that immediately follow any kind of value, variable or fixed width.
     * Calling any other append method will end the setup of adjacent value parsing.
     * Thus, in the unlikely event that you need to avoid adjacent value parsing behavior,
     * simply add the {@code appendValue} to another {@code DateTimeFormatterBuilder}
     * and add that to this builder.
     * <p>
     * If adjacent parsing is active, then parsing must match exactly the specified
     * number of digits in both strict and lenient modes.
     * In addition, no positive or negative sign is permitted.
