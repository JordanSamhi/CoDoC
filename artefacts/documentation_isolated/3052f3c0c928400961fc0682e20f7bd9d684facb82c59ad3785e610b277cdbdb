     * Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
     * {@code int} value that is less than or equal to the algebraic quotient.
     * There is one special case, if the dividend is the
     * {@linkplain Integer#MIN_VALUE Integer.MIN_VALUE} and the divisor is {@code -1},
     * then integer overflow occurs and
     * the result is equal to the {@code Integer.MIN_VALUE}.

     * Normal integer division operates under the round to zero rounding mode
     * (truncation).  This operation instead acts under the round toward
     * negative infinity (floor) rounding mode.
     * The floor rounding mode gives different results than truncation
     * when the exact result is negative.
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If the signs of the arguments are the same, the results of
     *       {@code floorDiv} and the {@code /} operator are the same.  <br>
     *       For example, {@code floorDiv(4, 3) == 1} and {@code (4 / 3) == 1}.</li>
     *   <li>If the signs of the arguments are different,  the quotient is negative and
     *       {@code floorDiv} returns the integer less than or equal to the quotient
     *       and the {@code /} operator returns the integer closest to zero.<br>
     *       For example, {@code floorDiv(-4, 3) == -2},
     *       whereas {@code (-4 / 3) == -1}.
