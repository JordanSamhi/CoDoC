     * <p>
     * Note: Closing a socket doesn't clear its binding state, which means
     * this method will return {@code true} for a closed socket
     * (see {@link #isClosed()}) if it was successfuly bound prior
     * to being closed.

     * @return true if the socket was successfuly bound to an address
