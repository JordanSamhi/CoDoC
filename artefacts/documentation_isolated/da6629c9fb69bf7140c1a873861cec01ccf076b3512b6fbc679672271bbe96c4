     * Repositions this stream to the position at the time the
     * <code>mark</code> method was last called on this input stream.
     *
     * <p> The general contract of <code>reset</code> is:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> If the method <code>markSupported</code> returns
     * <code>true</code>, then:
     *
     *     <ul><li> If the method <code>mark</code> has not been called since
     *     the stream was created, or the number of bytes read from the stream
     *     since <code>mark</code> was last called is larger than the argument
     *     to <code>mark</code> at that last call, then an
     *     <code>IOException</code> might be thrown.
     *
     *     <li> If such an <code>IOException</code> is not thrown, then the
     *     stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the
     *     most recent call to <code>mark</code> (or since the start of the
     *     file, if <code>mark</code> has not been called) will be resupplied
     *     to subsequent callers of the <code>read</code> method, followed by
     *     any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of
     *     the time of the call to <code>reset</code>. </ul>
     *
     * <li> If the method <code>markSupported</code> returns
     * <code>false</code>, then:
     *
     *     <ul><li> The call to <code>reset</code> may throw an
     *     <code>IOException</code>.
     *
     *     <li> If an <code>IOException</code> is not thrown, then the stream
     *     is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the
     *     input stream and how it was created. The bytes that will be supplied
     *     to subsequent callers of the <code>read</code> method depend on the
     *     particular type of the input stream. </ul></ul>
     *
     * <p>The method <code>reset</code> for class <code>InputStream</code>
     * does nothing except throw an <code>IOException</code>.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  if this stream has not been marked or if the
     *               mark has been invalidated.
