     * Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code int}
     * value from this random number generator's sequence. The general
     * contract of {@code nextInt} is that one {@code int} value is
     * pseudorandomly generated and returned. All 2<sup>32</sup> possible
     * {@code int} values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.
     *
     * <p>The method {@code nextInt} is implemented by class {@code Random}
     * as if by:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * public int nextInt() {
     *   return next(32);
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code int}
     *         value from this random number generator's sequence
