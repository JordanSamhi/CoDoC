     * Returns a copy of this date-time with the zone ID set to the offset.
     * <p>
     * This returns a zoned date-time where the zone ID is the same as {@link #getOffset()}.
     * The local date-time, offset and instant of the result will be the same as in this date-time.
     * <p>
     * Setting the date-time to a fixed single offset means that any future
     * calculations, such as addition or subtraction, have no complex edge cases
     * due to time-zone rules.
     * This might also be useful when sending a zoned date-time across a network,
     * as most protocols, such as ISO-8601, only handle offsets,
     * and not region-based zone IDs.
     * <p>
     * This is equivalent to {@code ZonedDateTime.of(zdt.toLocalDateTime(), zdt.getOffset())}.
     *
     * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} with the zone ID set to the offset, not null
