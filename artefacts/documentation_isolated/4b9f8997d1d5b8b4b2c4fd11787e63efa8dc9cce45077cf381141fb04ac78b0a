     * If this object has changed, as indicated by the
     * <code>hasChanged</code> method, then notify all of its observers
     * and then call the <code>clearChanged</code> method to
     * indicate that this object has no longer changed.
     * <p>
     * Each observer has its <code>update</code> method called with two
     * arguments: this observable object and <code>null</code>. In other
     * words, this method is equivalent to:
     * <blockquote><tt>
     * notifyObservers(null)</tt></blockquote>
