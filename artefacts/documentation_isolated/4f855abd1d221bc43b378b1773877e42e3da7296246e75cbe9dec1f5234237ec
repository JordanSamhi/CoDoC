     * Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer
     * than the current thread.
     *
     * <p>An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be
     * more efficient than):
     * <pre> {@code
     * getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread()
     *   && hasQueuedThreads()}</pre>
     *
     * <p>Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and
     * timeouts may occur at any time, a {@code true} return does not
     * guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current
     * thread.  Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a
     * race to enqueue after this method has returned {@code false},
     * due to the queue being empty.
     *
     * <p>This method is designed to be used by a fair synchronizer to
     * avoid <a href="AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.html#barging">barging</a>.
     * Such a synchronizer's {@link #tryAcquire} method should return
     * {@code false}, and its {@link #tryAcquireShared} method should
     * return a negative value, if this method returns {@code true}
     * (unless this is a reentrant acquire).  For example, the {@code
     * tryAcquire} method for a fair, reentrant, exclusive mode
     * synchronizer might look like this:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg) {
     *   if (isHeldExclusively()) {
     *     // A reentrant acquire; increment hold count
     *     return true;
     *   } else if (hasQueuedPredecessors()) {
     *     return false;
     *   } else {
     *     // try to acquire normally
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if there is a queued thread preceding the
     *         current thread, and {@code false} if the current thread
     *         is at the head of the queue or the queue is empty
     * @since 1.7
