     * Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this Vector
     * If the Vector does not contain the element, it is unchanged.  More
     * formally, removes the element with the lowest index i such that
     * {@code (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i)))} (if such
     * an element exists).
     *
     * @param o element to be removed from this Vector, if present
     * @return true if the Vector contained the specified element
