     * Returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack dump
     * of this thread.  This method will return a zero-length array if
     * this thread has not started, has started but has not yet been
     * scheduled to run by the system, or has terminated.
     * If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of
     * the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent
     * method invocation in the sequence.  The last element of the array
     * represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method
     * invocation in the sequence.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, and this thread is not
     * the current thread, then the security manager's
     * <tt>checkPermission</tt> method is called with a
     * <tt>RuntimePermission("getStackTrace")</tt> permission
     * to see if it's ok to get the stack trace.
     *
     * <p>Some virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
     * or more stack frames from the stack trace.  In the extreme case,
     * a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
     * this thread is permitted to return a zero-length array from this
     * method.
     *
     * @return an array of <tt>StackTraceElement</tt>,
     * each represents one stack frame.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *        if a security manager exists and its
     *        <tt>checkPermission</tt> method doesn't allow
     *        getting the stack trace of thread.
