     * @param readAheadLimit   Limit on the number of characters that may be
     *                         read while still preserving the mark. An attempt
     *                         to reset the stream after reading characters
     *                         up to this limit or beyond may fail.
     *                         A limit value larger than the size of the input
     *                         buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated
     *                         whose size is no smaller than limit.
     *                         Therefore large values should be used with care.

     * @exception  IllegalArgumentException  If {@code readAheadLimit < 0}
     * @exception  IOException  If an I/O error occurs
