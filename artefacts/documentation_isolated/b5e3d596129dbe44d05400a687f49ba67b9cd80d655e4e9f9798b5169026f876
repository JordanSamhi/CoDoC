     * Reads from the current JAR file entry into an array of bytes.
     * If <code>len</code> is not zero, the method
     * blocks until some input is available; otherwise, no
     * bytes are read and <code>0</code> is returned.
     * If verification has been enabled, any invalid signature
     * on the current entry will be reported at some point before the
     * end of the entry is reached.
     * @param b the buffer into which the data is read
     * @param off the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes to read
     * @return the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the
     *         entry is reached
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
     * <code>b.length - off</code>
     * @exception ZipException if a ZIP file error has occurred
     * @exception IOException if an I/O error has occurred
     * @exception SecurityException if any of the jar file entries
     *         are incorrectly signed.
