     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified queue.
     * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in
     * an immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a queue contains
     * no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe
     * view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the queue
     * takes place through the view, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the
     * queue cannot contain an incorrectly typed element.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
     * checkedCollection} method.
     *
     * <p>The returned queue will be serializable if the specified queue
     * is serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned queue permits insertion of {@code null} elements
     * whenever the backing queue does.
