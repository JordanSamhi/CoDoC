     * Calls the {@code store(OutputStream out, String comments)} method
     * and suppresses IOExceptions that were thrown.
     *
     * @deprecated This method does not throw an IOException if an I/O error
     * occurs while saving the property list.  The preferred way to save a
     * properties list is via the {@code store(OutputStream out,
     * String comments)} method or the
     * {@code storeToXML(OutputStream os, String comment)} method.
     *
     * @param   out      an output stream.
     * @param   comments   a description of the property list.
     * @exception  ClassCastException  if this {@code Properties} object
     *             contains any keys or values that are not
     *             {@code Strings}.
