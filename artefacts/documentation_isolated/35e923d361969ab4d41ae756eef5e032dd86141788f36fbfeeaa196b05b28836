     * <p> A return value of <tt>true</tt> implies that it is highly likely
     * that all of the data in this buffer is resident in physical memory and
     * may therefore be accessed without incurring any virtual-memory page
     * faults or I/O operations.  A return value of <tt>false</tt> does not
     * necessarily imply that the buffer's content is not resident in physical
     * memory.
     *
     * <p> The returned value is a hint, rather than a guarantee, because the
     * underlying operating system may have paged out some of the buffer's data
     * by the time that an invocation of this method returns.  </p>
     *
     * @return  <tt>true</tt> if it is likely that this buffer's content
     *          is resident in physical memory
