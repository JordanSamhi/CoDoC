         * at the time of invocation.

         * <p>Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock
         * are held by another thread
         * and returns immediately with the value {@code true},
         * setting the write lock hold count to one. Even when this lock has
         * been set to use a fair ordering policy, a call to
         * {@code tryLock()} <em>will</em> immediately acquire the
         * lock if it is available, whether or not other threads are
         * currently waiting for the write lock.  This &quot;barging&quot;
         * behavior can be useful in certain circumstances, even
         * though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor the
         * fairness setting for this lock, then use {@link
         * #tryLock(long, TimeUnit) tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) }
         * which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).
         *
         * <p>If the current thread already holds this lock then the
         * hold count is incremented by one and the method returns
         * {@code true}.
         *
         * <p>If the lock is held by another thread then this method
         * will return immediately with the value {@code false}.
         *
         * @return {@code true} if the lock was free and was acquired
         * by the current thread, or the write lock was already held
         * by the current thread; and {@code false} otherwise.
