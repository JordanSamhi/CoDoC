     * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a
     * {@code Map} whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided
     * mapping functions to the input elements.
     *
     * <p>If the mapped
     * keys contains duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}),
     * the value mapping function is applied to each equal element, and the
     * results are merged using the provided merging function.  The {@code Map}
     * is created by a provided supplier function.
     *
     * @implNote
     * The returned {@code Collector} is not concurrent.  For parallel stream
     * pipelines, the {@code combiner} function operates by merging the keys
     * from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation.  If it is
     * not required that results are merged into the {@code Map} in encounter
     * order, using {@link #toConcurrentMap(Function, Function, BinaryOperator, Supplier)}
     * may offer better parallel performance.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param <K> the output type of the key mapping function
     * @param <U> the output type of the value mapping function
     * @param <M> the type of the resulting {@code Map}
     * @param keyMapper a mapping function to produce keys
     * @param valueMapper a mapping function to produce values
     * @param mergeFunction a merge function, used to resolve collisions between
     *                      values associated with the same key, as supplied
     *                      to {@link Map#merge(Object, Object, BiFunction)}
     * @param mapSupplier a function which returns a new, empty {@code Map} into
     *                    which the results will be inserted
     * @return a {@code Collector} which collects elements into a {@code Map}
     * whose keys are the result of applying a key mapping function to the input
     * elements, and whose values are the result of applying a value mapping
     * function to all input elements equal to the key and combining them
     * using the merge function
