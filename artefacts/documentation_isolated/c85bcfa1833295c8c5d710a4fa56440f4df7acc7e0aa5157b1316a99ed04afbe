     * be automatically followed by this class.  True by default.  Applets
     * cannot change this variable.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager, this method first calls
     * the security manager's {@code checkSetFactory} method
     * to ensure the operation is allowed.
     * This could result in a SecurityException.
     *
     * @param set a {@code boolean} indicating whether or not
     * to follow HTTP redirects.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             {@code checkSetFactory} method doesn't
     *             allow the operation.
