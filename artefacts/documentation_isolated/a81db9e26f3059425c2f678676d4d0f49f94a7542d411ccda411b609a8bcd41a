     * Sets the last-modified time of the file or directory named by this

     * <p> All platforms support file-modification times to the nearest second,
     * but some provide more precision.  The argument will be truncated to fit
     * the supported precision.  If the operation succeeds and no intervening
     * operations on the file take place, then the next invocation of the
     * <code>{@link #lastModified}</code> method will return the (possibly
     * truncated) <code>time</code> argument that was passed to this method.
     *
     * @param  time  The new last-modified time, measured in milliseconds since
     *               the epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970)
     *
     * @return <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded;
     *          <code>false</code> otherwise
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException  If the argument is negative
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the named file
