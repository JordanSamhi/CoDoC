     * Sorts the specified range of the array into ascending numerical order.
     * The range to be sorted extends from the index {@code fromIndex},
     * inclusive, to the index {@code toIndex}, exclusive. If
     * {@code fromIndex == toIndex}, the range to be sorted is empty.
     *
     * <p>The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all float
     * values: {@code -0.0f == 0.0f} is {@code true} and a {@code Float.NaN}
     * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
     * even itself. This method uses the total order imposed by the method
     * {@link Float#compareTo}: {@code -0.0f} is treated as less than value
     * {@code 0.0f} and {@code Float.NaN} is considered greater than any
     * other value and all {@code Float.NaN} values are considered equal.
     *
     * @implNote The sorting algorithm is a parallel sort-merge that breaks the
     * array into sub-arrays that are themselves sorted and then merged. When
     * the sub-array length reaches a minimum granularity, the sub-array is
     * sorted using the appropriate {@link Arrays#sort(float[]) Arrays.sort}
     * method. If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum
     * granularity, then it is sorted using the appropriate {@link
     * Arrays#sort(float[]) Arrays.sort} method. The algorithm requires a working
     * space no greater than the size of the specified range of the original
     * array. The {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() ForkJoin common pool} is
     * used to execute any parallel tasks.
