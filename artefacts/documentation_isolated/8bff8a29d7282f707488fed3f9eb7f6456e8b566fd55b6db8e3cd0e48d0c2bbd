     * Get the decomposition mode of this Collator. Decomposition mode
     * determines how Unicode composed characters are handled. Adjusting
     * decomposition mode allows the user to select between faster and more
     * complete collation behavior.
     * <p>The three values for decomposition mode are:
     * <UL>
     * <LI>NO_DECOMPOSITION,
     * <LI>CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION
     * <LI>FULL_DECOMPOSITION.
     * </UL>
     * See the documentation for these three constants for a description
     * of their meaning.
