     * <p> This method is invoked only by Java code; when the garbage collector
     * enqueues references it does so directly, without invoking this method.
     *
     * @return   <code>true</code> if this reference object was successfully
     *           enqueued; <code>false</code> if it was already enqueued or if
     *           it was not registered with a queue when it was created
