     * Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.
     * <p>
     * This method first determines the content type of the object by
     * calling the {@code getContentType} method. If this is
     * the first time that the application has seen that specific content
     * type, a content handler for that content type is created:
     * <ol>
     * <li>If the application has set up a content handler factory instance
     *     using the {@code setContentHandlerFactory} method, the
     *     {@code createContentHandler} method of that instance is called
     *     with the content type as an argument; the result is a content
     *     handler for that content type.
     * <li>If no content handler factory has yet been set up, or if the
     *     factory's {@code createContentHandler} method returns
     *     {@code null}, then the application loads the class named:
     *     <blockquote><pre>
     *         sun.net.www.content.&lt;<i>contentType</i>&gt;
     *     </pre></blockquote>
     *     where &lt;<i>contentType</i>&gt; is formed by taking the
     *     content-type string, replacing all slash characters with a
     *     {@code period} ('.'), and all other non-alphanumeric characters
     *     with the underscore character '{@code _}'. The alphanumeric
     *     characters are specifically the 26 uppercase ASCII letters
     *     '{@code A}' through '{@code Z}', the 26 lowercase ASCII
     *     letters '{@code a}' through '{@code z}', and the 10 ASCII
     *     digits '{@code 0}' through '{@code 9}'. If the specified
     *     class does not exist, or is not a subclass of
     *     {@code ContentHandler}, then an
     *     {@code UnknownServiceException} is thrown.
     * </ol>
     *
     * @return     the object fetched. The {@code instanceof} operator
     *               should be used to determine the specific kind of object
     *               returned.
     * @exception  IOException              if an I/O error occurs while
     *               getting the content.
     * @exception  UnknownServiceException  if the protocol does not support
     *               the content type.
