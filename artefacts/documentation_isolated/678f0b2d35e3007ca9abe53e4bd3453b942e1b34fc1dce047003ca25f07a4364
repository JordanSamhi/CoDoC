     * Acquires in shared mode, aborting if interrupted.  Implemented
     * by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once
     * {@link #tryAcquireShared}, returning on success.  Otherwise the
     * thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking,
     * invoking {@link #tryAcquireShared} until success or the thread
     * is interrupted.
     * @param arg the acquire argument.
     * This value is conveyed to {@link #tryAcquireShared} but is
     * otherwise uninterpreted and can represent anything
     * you like.
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
