     * Returns the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than
     * or equal to zero, the {@code X509Certificates} must include a
     * basicConstraints extension with a pathLen of at least this value.
     * If the value is -2, only end-entity certificates are accepted. If
     * the value is -1, no basicConstraints check is done.
