     * The clock sequence value associated with this UUID.
     *
     * <p> The 14 bit clock sequence value is constructed from the clock
     * sequence field of this UUID.  The clock sequence field is used to
     * guarantee temporal uniqueness in a time-based UUID.
     *
     * <p> The {@code clockSequence} value is only meaningful in a time-based
     * UUID, which has version type 1.  If this UUID is not a time-based UUID
     * then this method throws UnsupportedOperationException.
     *
     * @return  The clock sequence of this {@code UUID}

     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID
