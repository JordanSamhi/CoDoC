     * Creates a {@code Spliterator} covering a range of elements of a given
     * array, using a customized set of spliterator characteristics.
     *
     * <p>This method is provided as an implementation convenience for
     * Spliterators which store portions of their elements in arrays, and need
     * fine control over Spliterator characteristics.  Most other situations in
     * which a Spliterator for an array is needed should use
     * {@link Arrays#spliterator(Object[])}.
     *
     * <p>The returned spliterator always reports the characteristics
     * {@code SIZED} and {@code SUBSIZED}.  The caller may provide additional
     * characteristics for the spliterator to report; it is common to
     * additionally specify {@code IMMUTABLE} and {@code ORDERED}.
     *
     * @param <T> Type of elements
     * @param array The array, assumed to be unmodified during use
     * @param fromIndex The least index (inclusive) to cover
     * @param toIndex One past the greatest index to cover
     * @param additionalCharacteristics Additional spliterator characteristics
     *        of this spliterator's source or elements beyond {@code SIZED} and
     *        {@code SUBSIZED} which are are always reported
     * @return A spliterator for an array
     * @throws NullPointerException if the given array is {@code null}
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if {@code fromIndex} is negative,
     *         {@code toIndex} is less than {@code fromIndex}, or
     *         {@code toIndex} is greater than the array size
