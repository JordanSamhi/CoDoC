     * Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
     * skipped over) from the current underlying input stream without
     * blocking by the next invocation of a method for the current
     * underlying input stream. The next invocation might be
     * the same thread or another thread.  A single read or skip of this
     * many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
     * <p>
     * This method simply calls {@code available} of the current underlying
     * input stream and returns the result.

     *         without blocking or {@code 0} if this input stream
