     * <p>Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available and
     * returns immediately, with the value {@code true},
     * reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.
     *
     * <p>If insufficient permits are available then
     * the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
     * purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes one of the {@link #release() release}
     * methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
     * permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the permits are acquired then the value {@code true} is returned.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * to acquire the permits,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     * Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread, are instead
     * assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
     * the permits had been made available by a call to {@link #release()}.
     *
     * <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then the value {@code false}
     * is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
     * will not wait at all.  Any permits that were to be assigned to this
     * thread, are instead assigned to other threads trying to acquire
     * permits, as if the permits had been made available by a call to
     * {@link #release()}.
     *
     * @param permits the number of permits to acquire
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait for the permits
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code timeout} argument
     * @return {@code true} if all permits were acquired and {@code false}
     *         if the waiting time elapsed before all permits were acquired
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
