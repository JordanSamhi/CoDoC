     * Gets the amount of daylight savings in use for the specified instant in this zone.
     * <p>
     * This provides access to historic information on how the amount of daylight
     * savings has changed over time.
     * This is the difference between the standard offset and the actual offset.
     * Typically the amount is zero during winter and one hour during summer.
     * Time-zones are second-based, so the nanosecond part of the duration will be zero.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation calculates the duration from the
     * {@link #getOffset(java.time.Instant) actual} and
     * {@link #getStandardOffset(java.time.Instant) standard} offsets.
     *
     * @param instant  the instant to find the daylight savings for, not null, but null
     *  may be ignored if the rules have a single offset for all instants
     * @return the difference between the standard and actual offset, not null
