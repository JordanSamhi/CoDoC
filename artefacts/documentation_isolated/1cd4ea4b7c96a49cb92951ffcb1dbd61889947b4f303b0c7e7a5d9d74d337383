     * This method is used to enable streaming of a HTTP request body
     * without internal buffering, when the content length is known in
     * advance.
     * <p>
     * An exception will be thrown if the application
     * attempts to write more data than the indicated
     * content-length, or if the application closes the OutputStream
     * before writing the indicated amount.
     * <p>
     * When output streaming is enabled, authentication
     * and redirection cannot be handled automatically.
     * A HttpRetryException will be thrown when reading
     * the response if authentication or redirection are required.
     * This exception can be queried for the details of the error.
     * <p>
     * This method must be called before the URLConnection is connected.
     * <p>
     * <B>NOTE:</B> {@link #setFixedLengthStreamingMode(long)} is recommended
     * instead of this method as it allows larger content lengths to be set.
     *
     * @param   contentLength The number of bytes which will be written
     *          to the OutputStream.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalStateException if URLConnection is already connected
     *          or if a different streaming mode is already enabled.
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException if a content length less than
     *          zero is specified.
