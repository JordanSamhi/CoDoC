     * Return the context of the single, global Application object of the
     * current process.  This generally should only be used if you need a
     * Context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context, that is
     * tied to the lifetime of the process rather than the current component.
     *
     * <p>Consider for example how this interacts with
     * {@link #registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter)}:
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>If used from an Activity context, the receiver is being registered
     * within that activity.  This means that you are expected to unregister
     * before the activity is done being destroyed; in fact if you do not do
     * so, the framework will clean up your leaked registration as it removes
     * the activity and log an error.  Thus, if you use the Activity context
     * to register a receiver that is static (global to the process, not
     * associated with an Activity instance) then that registration will be
     * removed on you at whatever point the activity you used is destroyed.
     * <li> <p>If used from the Context returned here, the receiver is being
     * registered with the global state associated with your application.  Thus
     * it will never be unregistered for you.  This is necessary if the receiver
     * is associated with static data, not a particular component.  However
     * using the ApplicationContext elsewhere can easily lead to serious leaks
     * if you forget to unregister, unbind, etc.
     * </ul>
