     * <p>An invocation of this method of the form
     * <tt>findWithinHorizon(pattern)</tt> behaves in exactly the same way as
     * the invocation
     * <tt>findWithinHorizon(Pattern.compile(pattern, horizon))</tt>.
     *
     * @param pattern a string specifying the pattern to search for
     * @param horizon the search horizon
     * @return the text that matched the specified pattern
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this scanner is closed
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if horizon is negative
