     * Compares the specified object with this list for equality.
     * Returns {@code true} if the specified object is the same object
     * as this object, or if it is also a {@link List} and the sequence
     * of elements returned by an {@linkplain List#iterator() iterator}
     * over the specified list is the same as the sequence returned by
     * an iterator over this list.  The two sequences are considered to
     * be the same if they have the same length and corresponding
     * elements at the same position in the sequence are <em>equal</em>.
     * Two elements {@code e1} and {@code e2} are considered
     * <em>equal</em> if {@code Objects.equals(e1, e2)}.

     * @param o the object to be compared for equality with this list
