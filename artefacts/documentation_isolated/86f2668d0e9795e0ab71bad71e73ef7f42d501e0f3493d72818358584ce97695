     * Returns the unique {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel FileChannel}
     * object associated with this file output stream.
     *
     * <p> The initial {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel#position()
     * position} of the returned channel will be equal to the
     * number of bytes written to the file so far unless this stream is in
     * append mode, in which case it will be equal to the size of the file.
     * Writing bytes to this stream will increment the channel's position
     * accordingly.  Changing the channel's position, either explicitly or by
     * writing, will change this stream's file position.
     *
     * @return  the file channel associated with this file output stream
