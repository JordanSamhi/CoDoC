     * Creates an asynchronous channel group with a given thread pool.
     *
     * <p> The {@code executor} parameter is an {@code ExecutorService} that
     * executes tasks submitted to dispatch completion results for operations
     * initiated on asynchronous channels in the group.
     *
     * <p> Care should be taken when configuring the executor service. It
     * should support <em>direct handoff</em> or <em>unbounded queuing</em> of
     * submitted tasks, and the thread that invokes the {@link
     * ExecutorService#execute execute} method should never invoke the task
     * directly. An implementation may mandate additional constraints.
     *
     * <p> The executor is intended to be used exclusively by the resulting
     * asynchronous channel group. Termination of the group results in the
     * orderly  {@link ExecutorService#shutdown shutdown} of the executor
     * service. Shutting down the executor service by other means results in
     * unspecified behavior.
     *
     * <p> The group is created by invoking the {@link
     * AsynchronousChannelProvider#openAsynchronousChannelGroup(ExecutorService,int)
     * openAsynchronousChannelGroup(ExecutorService,int)} method of the system-wide
     * default {@link AsynchronousChannelProvider} object with an {@code
     * initialSize} of {@code 0}.
     *
     * @param   executor
     *          The thread pool for the resulting group

     * @return  A new asynchronous channel group

     * @throws  IOException
