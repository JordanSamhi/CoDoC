         * Makes a <a href="MethodHandleInfo.html#directmh">direct method handle</a>
         * to <i>m</i>, if the lookup class has permission.
         * If <i>m</i> is non-static, the receiver argument is treated as an initial argument.
         * If <i>m</i> is virtual, overriding is respected on every call.
         * Unlike the Core Reflection API, exceptions are <em>not</em> wrapped.
         * The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
         * with the receiver type prepended (but only if it is non-static).
         * If the method's {@code accessible} flag is not set,
         * access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
         * If <i>m</i> is not public, do not share the resulting handle with untrusted parties.
         * <p>
         * The returned method handle will have
         * {@linkplain MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector variable arity} if and only if
         * the method's variable arity modifier bit ({@code 0x0080}) is set.
         * <p>
         * If <i>m</i> is static, and
         * if the returned method handle is invoked, the method's class will
         * be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.
         * @param m the reflected method
         * @return a method handle which can invoke the reflected method
         * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails
         *                                or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
         *                                is set and {@code asVarargsCollector} fails
         * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null
