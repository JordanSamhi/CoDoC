     * Creates a new and empty file, failing if the file already exists. The
     * check for the existence of the file and the creation of the new file if
     * it does not exist are a single operation that is atomic with respect to
     * all other filesystem activities that might affect the directory.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is optional {@link FileAttribute
     * file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
     * is identified by its {@link FileAttribute#name name}. If more than one
     * attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
     * occurrence is ignored.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to create
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the file
     *
     * @return  the file
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the file
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if a file of that name already exists
     *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the new file.
