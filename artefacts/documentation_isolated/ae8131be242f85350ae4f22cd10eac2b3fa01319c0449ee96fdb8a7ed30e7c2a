     * Appends the chronology ID, such as 'ISO' or 'ThaiBuddhist', to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This appends an instruction to format/parse the chronology ID to the builder.
     * <p>
     * During formatting, the chronology is obtained using a mechanism equivalent
     * to querying the temporal with {@link TemporalQueries#chronology()}.
     * It will be printed using the result of {@link Chronology#getId()}.
     * If the chronology cannot be obtained then an exception is thrown unless the
     * section of the formatter is optional.
     * <p>
     * During parsing, the chronology is parsed and must match one of the chronologies
     * in {@link Chronology#getAvailableChronologies()}.
     * If the chronology cannot be parsed then an exception is thrown unless the
     * section of the formatter is optional.
     * The parser uses the {@linkplain #parseCaseInsensitive() case sensitive} setting.

     * @return this, for chaining, not null
