     * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffers.
     *
     * <p> Bytes are written starting at this channel's current file position
     * unless the channel is in append mode, in which case the position is
     * first advanced to the end of the file.  The file is grown, if necessary,
     * to accommodate the written bytes, and then the file position is updated
     * with the number of bytes actually written.  Otherwise this method
     * behaves exactly as specified in the {@link GatheringByteChannel}
     * interface.  </p>
