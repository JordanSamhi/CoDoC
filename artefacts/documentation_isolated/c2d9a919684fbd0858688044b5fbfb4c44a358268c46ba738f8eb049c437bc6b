     * Appends the reduced value of a date-time field to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This is typically used for formatting and parsing a two digit year.
     * <p>
     * The base date is used to calculate the full value during parsing.
     * For example, if the base date is 1950-01-01 then parsed values for
     * a two digit year parse will be in the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
     * Only the year would be extracted from the date, thus a base date of
     * 1950-08-25 would also parse to the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
     * This behavior is necessary to support fields such as week-based-year
     * or other calendar systems where the parsed value does not align with
     * standard ISO years.
     * <p>
     * The exact behavior is as follows. Parse the full set of fields and
     * determine the effective chronology using the last chronology if
     * it appears more than once. Then convert the base date to the
     * effective chronology. Then extract the specified field from the
     * chronology-specific base date and use it to determine the
     * {@code baseValue} used below.
     * <p>
     * For formatting, the {@code width} and {@code maxWidth} are used to
     * determine the number of characters to format.
     * If they are equal then the format is fixed width.
     * If the value of the field is within the range of the {@code baseValue} using
     * {@code width} characters then the reduced value is formatted otherwise the value is
     * truncated to fit {@code maxWidth}.
     * The rightmost characters are output to match the width, left padding with zero.
     * <p>
     * For strict parsing, the number of characters allowed by {@code width} to {@code maxWidth} are parsed.
     * For lenient parsing, the number of characters must be at least 1 and less than 10.
     * If the number of digits parsed is equal to {@code width} and the value is positive,
     * the value of the field is computed to be the first number greater than
     * or equal to the {@code baseValue} with the same least significant characters,
     * otherwise the value parsed is the field value.
     * This allows a reduced value to be entered for values in range of the baseValue
     * and width and absolute values can be entered for values outside the range.
     * <p>
     * For example, a base value of {@code 1980} and a width of {@code 2} will have
     * valid values from {@code 1980} to {@code 2079}.
     * During parsing, the text {@code "12"} will result in the value {@code 2012} as that
     * is the value within the range where the last two characters are "12".
     * By contrast, parsing the text {@code "1915"} will result in the value {@code 1915}.
