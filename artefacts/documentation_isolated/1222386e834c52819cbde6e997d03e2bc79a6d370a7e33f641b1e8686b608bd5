     * Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down to
     * zero, unless the thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>If the current count is zero then this method returns immediately.
     *
     * <p>If the current count is greater than zero then the current
     * thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
     * dormant until one of two things happen:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The count reaches zero due to invocations of the
     * {@link #countDown} method; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     *         while waiting
