     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code OffsetTime}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
     * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented by
     * {@link LocalTime#plus(long, TemporalUnit)}.
     * The offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
     * whether and how to perform the addition.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
