     * Opens or creates a file, returning a seekable byte channel to access the
     * file.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#WRITE WRITE} options determine if the file should be
     * opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option (or the {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} option) is present then the file is
     * opened for reading. By default reading or writing commence at the
     * beginning of the file.
     *
     * <p> In the addition to {@code READ} and {@code WRITE}, the following
     * options may be present:

     *     each invocation of the channel's {@code write} method first advances
     *     the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
     *     data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
     *     data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
     *     therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
     *     with the {@code READ} or {@code TRUNCATE_EXISTING} options. </td>

     *     SeekableByteChannel sbc = Files.newByteChannel(path, EnumSet.of(CREATE_NEW,READ,WRITE), perms);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the file
     *
     * @return  a new seekable byte channel
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the set contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported open option is specified or the array contains
     *          attributes that cannot be set atomically when creating the file
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if a file of that name already exists and the {@link
     *          StandardOpenOption#CREATE_NEW CREATE_NEW} option is specified
     *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
     *          opened for reading. The {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)
     *          checkWrite} method is invoked to check write access to the path
     *          if the file is opened for writing. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete} method is
     *          invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the
     *          {@code DELETE_ON_CLOSE} option.
