     * Sets the pathToNames criterion. The {@code X509Certificate} must
     * not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
     * path to the specified names.
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
     * the complete set of names which the {@code X509Certificates}'s
     * name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces
     * the previous value for the pathToNames criterion.
     * <p>
     * This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
     * (from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
     * built, any candidate certificate must not include name constraints that
     * would prohibit building a path to any of the names in the partial path.
     * <p>
     * The {@code names} parameter (if not {@code null}) is a
     * {@code Collection} with one
     * entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames
     * criterion. Each entry is a {@code List} whose first entry is an
     * {@code Integer} (the name type, 0-8) and whose second
     * entry is a {@code String} or a byte array (the name, in
     * string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).
     * There can be multiple names of the same type. If {@code null}
     * is supplied as the value for this argument, no
     * pathToNames check will be performed.
     * <p>
     * Each name in the {@code Collection}
     * may be specified either as a {@code String} or as an ASN.1 encoded
     * byte array. For more details about the formats used, see
     * {@link #addPathToName(int type, String name)
     * addPathToName(int type, String name)} and
     * {@link #addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)
     * addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> for distinguished names, specify the byte
     * array form instead of the String form. See the note in
     * {@link #addPathToName(int, String)} for more information.
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code names} parameter can contain duplicate
     * names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the
     * {@code Collection} of names returned by the
     * {@link #getPathToNames getPathToNames} method.
     * <p>
     * Note that a deep copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
     * protect against subsequent modifications.
