     * Returns a collection containing those threads that may be
     * waiting on the given condition associated with this
     * synchronizer.  Because the actual set of threads may change
     * dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
     * collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
     * returned collection are in no particular order.

     * @param condition the condition
     * @return the collection of threads
     * @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if exclusive synchronization
     *         is not held
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the given condition is
     *         not associated with this synchronizer
     * @throws NullPointerException if the condition is null
