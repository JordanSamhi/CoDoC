     * Returns the next pseudorandom, Gaussian ("normally") distributed
     * {@code double} value with mean {@code 0.0} and standard
     * deviation {@code 1.0} from this random number generator's sequence.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code nextGaussian} is that one
     * {@code double} value, chosen from (approximately) the usual
     * normal distribution with mean {@code 0.0} and standard deviation
     * {@code 1.0}, is pseudorandomly generated and returned.
     *
     * <p>The method {@code nextGaussian} is implemented by class
     * {@code Random} as if by a threadsafe version of the following:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * private double nextNextGaussian;
     * private boolean haveNextNextGaussian = false;
     *
     * public double nextGaussian() {
     *   if (haveNextNextGaussian) {
     *     haveNextNextGaussian = false;
     *     return nextNextGaussian;
     *   } else {
     *     double v1, v2, s;
     *     do {
     *       v1 = 2 * nextDouble() - 1;   // between -1.0 and 1.0
     *       v2 = 2 * nextDouble() - 1;   // between -1.0 and 1.0
     *       s = v1 * v1 + v2 * v2;
     *     } while (s >= 1 || s == 0);
     *     double multiplier = StrictMath.sqrt(-2 * StrictMath.log(s)/s);
     *     nextNextGaussian = v2 * multiplier;
     *     haveNextNextGaussian = true;
     *     return v1 * multiplier;
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     * This uses the <i>polar method</i> of G. E. P. Box, M. E. Muller, and
     * G. Marsaglia, as described by Donald E. Knuth in <i>The Art of
     * Computer Programming</i>, Volume 3: <i>Seminumerical Algorithms</i>,
     * section 3.4.1, subsection C, algorithm P. Note that it generates two
     * independent values at the cost of only one call to {@code StrictMath.log}
     * and one call to {@code StrictMath.sqrt}.
     *
     * @return the next pseudorandom, Gaussian ("normally") distributed
