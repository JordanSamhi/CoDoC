     * Returns the {@code double} value that is closest in value
     * to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. If two
     * {@code double} values that are mathematical integers are
     * equally close to the value of the argument, the result is the
     * integer value that is even. Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a mathematical
     * integer, then the result is the same as the argument.
     * <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or positive zero or negative
     * zero, then the result is the same as the argument.</ul>
     *
     * @param   a   a value.
     * @return  the closest floating-point value to {@code a} that is
     *          equal to a mathematical integer.
