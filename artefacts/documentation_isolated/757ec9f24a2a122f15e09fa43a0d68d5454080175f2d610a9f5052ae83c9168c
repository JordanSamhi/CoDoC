     * Calculates the amount of time until another instant in terms of the specified unit.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code Instant}
     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified instant.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two instants.
     * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
     * {@code Instant} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
     * using {@code startInstant.until(endInstant, SECONDS)}.
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   amount = start.until(end, SECONDS);
     *   amount = SECONDS.between(start, end);
     * </pre>
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
     * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS}, {@code HALF_DAYS} and {@code DAYS}
     * are supported. Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param endExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an {@code Instant}, not null
     * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
     * @return the amount of time between this instant and the end instant
     * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
     *  temporal cannot be converted to an {@code Instant}
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
