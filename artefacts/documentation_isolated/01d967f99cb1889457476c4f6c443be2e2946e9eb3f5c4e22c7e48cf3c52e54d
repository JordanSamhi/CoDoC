     * Sets the owner's or everybody's execute permission for this abstract
     * pathname.
     *
     * <p> The {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines methods that operate on
     * file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
     * manipulation of file permissions is required.
     *
     * @param   executable
     *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow execute
     *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow execute operations
     *
     * @param   ownerOnly
     *          If <code>true</code>, the execute permission applies only to the
     *          owner's execute permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.
     *          If the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's
     *          execute permission from that of others, then the permission will
     *          apply to everybody, regardless of this value.
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded.  The
     *          operation will fail if the user does not have permission to
     *          change the access permissions of this abstract pathname.  If
     *          <code>executable</code> is <code>false</code> and the underlying
     *          file system does not implement an execute permission, then the
     *          operation will fail.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies write access to the file
