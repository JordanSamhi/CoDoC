         * Generates a new customized Language Priority List using the given
         * {@code priorityList} and {@code map}. If the given {@code map} is
         * empty, this method returns a copy of the given {@code priorityList}.
         *
         * <p>In the map, a key represents a language range whereas a value is
         * a list of equivalents of it. {@code '*'} cannot be used in the map.
         * Each equivalent language range has the same weight value as its
         * original language range.
         *
         * <pre>
         *  An example of map:
         *    <b>Key</b>                            <b>Value</b>
         *      "zh" (Chinese)                 "zh",
         *                                     "zh-Hans"(Simplified Chinese)
         *      "zh-HK" (Chinese, Hong Kong)   "zh-HK"
         *      "zh-TW" (Chinese, Taiwan)      "zh-TW"
         * </pre>
         *
         * The customization is performed after modification using the IANA
         * Language Subtag Registry.
         *
         * <p>For example, if a user's Language Priority List consists of five
         * language ranges ({@code "zh"}, {@code "zh-CN"}, {@code "en"},
         * {@code "zh-TW"}, and {@code "zh-HK"}), the newly generated Language
         * Priority List which is customized using the above map example will
         * consists of {@code "zh"}, {@code "zh-Hans"}, {@code "zh-CN"},
         * {@code "zh-Hans-CN"}, {@code "en"}, {@code "zh-TW"}, and
         * {@code "zh-HK"}.
         *
         * <p>{@code "zh-HK"} and {@code "zh-TW"} aren't converted to
         * {@code "zh-Hans-HK"} nor {@code "zh-Hans-TW"} even if they are
         * included in the Language Priority List. In this example, mapping
         * is used to clearly distinguish Simplified Chinese and Traditional
         * Chinese.
         *
         * <p>If the {@code "zh"}-to-{@code "zh"} mapping isn't included in the
         * map, a simple replacement will be performed and the customized list
         * won't include {@code "zh"} and {@code "zh-CN"}.
         *
         * @param priorityList user's Language Priority List
         * @param map a map containing information to customize language ranges
         * @return a new Language Priority List with customization. The list is
         *     modifiable.
         * @throws NullPointerException if {@code priorityList} is {@code null}
         * @see #parse(String, Map)
