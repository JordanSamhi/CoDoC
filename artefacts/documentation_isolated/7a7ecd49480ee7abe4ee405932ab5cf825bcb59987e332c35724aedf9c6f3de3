     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified collection.
     * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an
     * immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a collection
     * contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a
     * dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent
     * access to the collection takes place through the view, it is
     * <i>guaranteed</i> that the collection cannot contain an incorrectly
     * typed element.
     *
     * <p>The generics mechanism in the language provides compile-time
     * (static) type checking, but it is possible to defeat this mechanism
     * with unchecked casts.  Usually this is not a problem, as the compiler
     * issues warnings on all such unchecked operations.  There are, however,
     * times when static type checking alone is not sufficient.  For example,
     * suppose a collection is passed to a third-party library and it is
     * imperative that the library code not corrupt the collection by
     * inserting an element of the wrong type.
     *
     * <p>Another use of dynamically typesafe views is debugging.  Suppose a
     * program fails with a {@code ClassCastException}, indicating that an
     * incorrectly typed element was put into a parameterized collection.
     * Unfortunately, the exception can occur at any time after the erroneous
     * element is inserted, so it typically provides little or no information
     * as to the real source of the problem.  If the problem is reproducible,
     * one can quickly determine its source by temporarily modifying the
     * program to wrap the collection with a dynamically typesafe view.
     * For example, this declaration:
     *  <pre> {@code
     *     Collection<String> c = new HashSet<>();
     * }</pre>
     * may be replaced temporarily by this one:
     *  <pre> {@code
     *     Collection<String> c = Collections.checkedCollection(
     *         new HashSet<>(), String.class);
     * }</pre>
     * Running the program again will cause it to fail at the point where
     * an incorrectly typed element is inserted into the collection, clearly
     * identifying the source of the problem.  Once the problem is fixed, the
     * modified declaration may be reverted back to the original.
     *
     * <p>The returned collection does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals
     * operations through to the backing collection, but relies on
     * {@code Object}'s {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods.  This
     * is necessary to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case
     * that the backing collection is a set or a list.
     *
     * <p>The returned collection will be serializable if the specified
     * collection is serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned collection permits insertion of null elements
     * whenever the backing collection does.
     *
     * @param <E> the class of the objects in the collection
     * @param c the collection for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be
     *          returned
     * @param type the type of element that {@code c} is permitted to hold
     * @return a dynamically typesafe view of the specified collection
     * @since 1.5
