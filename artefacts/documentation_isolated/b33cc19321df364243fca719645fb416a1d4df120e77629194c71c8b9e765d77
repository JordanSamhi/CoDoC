     * local time-line as the other date.

     *   LocalDate a = LocalDate.of(2012, 6, 30);
     *   LocalDate b = LocalDate.of(2012, 7, 1);

     * This method only considers the position of the two dates on the local time-line.
     * It does not take into account the chronology, or calendar system.
     * This is different from the comparison in {@link #compareTo(ChronoLocalDate)}
     * but is the same approach as {@link ChronoLocalDate#timeLineOrder()}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this date is equal to the specified date
