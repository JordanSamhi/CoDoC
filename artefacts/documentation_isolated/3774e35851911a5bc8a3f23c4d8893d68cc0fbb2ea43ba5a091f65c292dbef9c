     * Reads bytes from this byte-input stream into the specified byte array,
     * starting at the given offset.
     *
     * <p> This method implements the general contract of the corresponding
     * <code>{@link InputStream#read(byte[], int, int) read}</code> method of
     * the <code>{@link InputStream}</code> class.  As an additional
     * convenience, it attempts to read as many bytes as possible by repeatedly
     * invoking the <code>read</code> method of the underlying stream.  This
     * iterated <code>read</code> continues until one of the following
     * conditions becomes true: <ul>
     *
     *   <li> The specified number of bytes have been read,
     *
     *   <li> The <code>read</code> method of the underlying stream returns
     *   <code>-1</code>, indicating end-of-file, or
     *
     *   <li> The <code>available</code> method of the underlying stream
     *   returns zero, indicating that further input requests would block.
     *
     * </ul> If the first <code>read</code> on the underlying stream returns
     * <code>-1</code> to indicate end-of-file then this method returns
     * <code>-1</code>.  Otherwise this method returns the number of bytes
     * actually read.
     *
     * <p> Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
     * attempt to read as many bytes as possible in the same fashion.
     *
     * @param      b     destination buffer.
     * @param      off   offset at which to start storing bytes.
     * @param      len   maximum number of bytes to read.
     * @return     the number of bytes read, or <code>-1</code> if the end of
     *             the stream has been reached.
     * @exception  IOException  if this input stream has been closed by
     *                          invoking its {@link #close()} method,
     *                          or an I/O error occurs.
