     * Returns a copy of the Attributes, implemented as follows:
     * <pre>
     *     public Object clone() { return new Attributes(this); }
     * </pre>
     * Since the attribute names and values are themselves immutable,
     * the Attributes returned can be safely modified without affecting
     * the original.
