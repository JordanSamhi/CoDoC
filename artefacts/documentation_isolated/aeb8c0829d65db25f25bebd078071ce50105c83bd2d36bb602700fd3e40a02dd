     * Opens a file, returning an input stream to read from the file. This
     * method works in exactly the manner specified by the {@link
     * Files#newInputStream} method.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method opens a channel to the file
     * as if by invoking the {@link #newByteChannel} method and constructs a
     * stream that reads bytes from the channel. This method should be overridden
     * where appropriate.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new input stream
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if an invalid combination of options is specified
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
