     * Sorts the specified range of the specified array of objects into
     * ascending order, according to the
     * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} of its
     * elements.  The range to be sorted extends from index
     * {@code fromIndex}, inclusive, to index {@code toIndex}, exclusive.
     * (If {@code fromIndex==toIndex}, the range to be sorted is empty.)  All
     * elements in this range must implement the {@link Comparable}
     * interface.  Furthermore, all elements in this range must be <i>mutually
     * comparable</i> (that is, {@code e1.compareTo(e2)} must not throw a
     * {@code ClassCastException} for any elements {@code e1} and
     * {@code e2} in the array).
     *
     * <p>This sort is guaranteed to be <i>stable</i>:  equal elements will
     * not be reordered as a result of the sort.
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: This implementation is a stable, adaptive,
     * iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons
     * when the input array is partially sorted, while offering the
     * performance of a traditional mergesort when the input array is
     * randomly ordered.  If the input array is nearly sorted, the
     * implementation requires approximately n comparisons.  Temporary
     * storage requirements vary from a small constant for nearly sorted
     * input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly ordered input
     * arrays.
     *
     * <p>The implementation takes equal advantage of ascending and
     * descending order in its input array, and can take advantage of
     * ascending and descending order in different parts of the the same
     * input array.  It is well-suited to merging two or more sorted arrays:
     * simply concatenate the arrays and sort the resulting array.
     *
     * <p>The implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for Python
     * (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt">
     * TimSort</a>).  It uses techniques from Peter McIlroy's "Optimistic
     * Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity", in Proceedings of the
     * Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp 467-474,
     * January 1993.
