     * Creates a {@code Spliterator} using a given {@code Iterator}
     * as the source of elements, and with a given initially reported size.
     *
     * <p>The spliterator is not
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>, inherits
     * the <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the iterator, and implements
     * {@code trySplit} to permit limited parallelism.
     *
     * <p>Traversal of elements should be accomplished through the spliterator.
     * The behaviour of splitting and traversal is undefined if the iterator is
     * operated on after the spliterator is returned, or the initially reported
     * size is not equal to the actual number of elements in the source.
     *
     * @param <T> Type of elements
     * @param iterator The iterator for the source
     * @param size The number of elements in the source, to be reported as
     *        initial {@code estimateSize}
     * @param characteristics Characteristics of this spliterator's source or
     *        elements.  The characteristics {@code SIZED} and {@code SUBSIZED}
     *        are additionally reported unless {@code CONCURRENT} is supplied.
     * @return A spliterator from an iterator
     * @throws NullPointerException if the given iterator is {@code null}
