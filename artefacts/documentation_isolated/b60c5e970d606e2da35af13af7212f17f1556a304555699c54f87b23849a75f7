     * Determines if the given {@code char} value is a Unicode
     * <i>surrogate code unit</i>.
     *
     * <p>Such values do not represent characters by themselves,
     * but are used in the representation of
     * <a href="#supplementary">supplementary characters</a>
     * in the UTF-16 encoding.
     *
     * <p>A char value is a surrogate code unit if and only if it is either
     * a {@linkplain #isLowSurrogate(char) low-surrogate code unit} or
     * a {@linkplain #isHighSurrogate(char) high-surrogate code unit}.
     *
     * @param  ch the {@code char} value to be tested.
     * @return {@code true} if the {@code char} value is between
     *         {@link #MIN_SURROGATE} and
     *         {@link #MAX_SURROGATE} inclusive;
     *         {@code false} otherwise.
