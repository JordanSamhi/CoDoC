     * Casts this {@code Class} object to represent a subclass of the class
     * represented by the specified class object.  Checks that the cast
     * is valid, and throws a {@code ClassCastException} if it is not.  If
     * this method succeeds, it always returns a reference to this class object.
     *
     * <p>This method is useful when a client needs to "narrow" the type of
     * a {@code Class} object to pass it to an API that restricts the
     * {@code Class} objects that it is willing to accept.  A cast would
     * generate a compile-time warning, as the correctness of the cast
     * could not be checked at runtime (because generic types are implemented
     * by erasure).
     *
     * @param <U> the type to cast this class object to
     * @param clazz the class of the type to cast this class object to
     * @return this {@code Class} object, cast to represent a subclass of
     *    the specified class object.
     * @throws ClassCastException if this {@code Class} object does not
     *    represent a subclass of the specified class (here "subclass" includes
     *    the class itself).
