     * Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum {@code DayOfWeek}.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the enum {@link DayOfWeek} for the day-of-week.
     * This avoids confusion as to what {@code int} values mean.
     * If you need access to the primitive {@code int} value then the enum
     * provides the {@link DayOfWeek#getValue() int value}.
     * <p>
     * Additional information can be obtained from the {@code DayOfWeek}.
     * This includes textual names of the values.
     *
     * @return the day-of-week, not null
