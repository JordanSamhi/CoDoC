     * Returns a string describing this {@code Method}, including
     * type parameters.  The string is formatted as the method access
     * modifiers, if any, followed by an angle-bracketed
     * comma-separated list of the method's type parameters, if any,
     * followed by the method's generic return type, followed by a
     * space, followed by the class declaring the method, followed by
     * a period, followed by the method name, followed by a
     * parenthesized, comma-separated list of the method's generic
     * formal parameter types.
     *
     * If this method was declared to take a variable number of
     * arguments, instead of denoting the last parameter as
     * "<tt><i>Type</i>[]</tt>", it is denoted as
     * "<tt><i>Type</i>...</tt>".
     *
     * A space is used to separate access modifiers from one another
     * and from the type parameters or return type.  If there are no
     * type parameters, the type parameter list is elided; if the type
     * parameter list is present, a space separates the list from the
     * class name.  If the method is declared to throw exceptions, the
     * parameter list is followed by a space, followed by the word
     * throws followed by a comma-separated list of the generic thrown
     * exception types.
     *
     * <p>The access modifiers are placed in canonical order as
     * specified by "The Java Language Specification".  This is
     * {@code public}, {@code protected} or {@code private} first,
     * and then other modifiers in the following order:
     * {@code abstract}, {@code default}, {@code static}, {@code final},
     * {@code synchronized}, {@code native}, {@code strictfp}.
