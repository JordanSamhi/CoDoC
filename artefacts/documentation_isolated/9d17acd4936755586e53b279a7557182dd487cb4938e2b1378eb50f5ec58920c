     * Obtains an instance of {@code Chronology} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a chronology based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code Chronology}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion will obtain the chronology using {@link TemporalQueries#chronology()}.
     * If the specified temporal object does not have a chronology, {@link IsoChronology} is returned.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code Chronology::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal to convert, not null
     * @return the chronology, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to an {@code Chronology}
