     * Returns the unique {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel FileChannel}
     * object associated with this file input stream.
     *
     * <p> The initial {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel#position()
     * position} of the returned channel will be equal to the
     * number of bytes read from the file so far.  Reading bytes from this
     * stream will increment the channel's position.  Changing the channel's
     * position, either explicitly or by reading, will change this stream's
     * file position.
