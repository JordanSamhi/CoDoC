     * Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
     * by this iterator (optional operation).  This method can be called
     * only once per call to {@link #next}.  The behavior of an iterator
     * is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified while the
     * iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this
     * method.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation throws an instance of
     * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} and performs no other action.
     *
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the {@code remove}
     *         operation is not supported by this iterator
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the {@code next} method has not
     *         yet been called, or the {@code remove} method has already
     *         been called after the last call to the {@code next}
     *         method
