     * Sets the source and destination for subprocess standard I/O
     * to be the same as those of the current Java process.

     * <p>This is a convenience method.  An invocation of the form
     *  <pre> {@code
     * pb.inheritIO()
     * }</pre>
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
     *  <pre> {@code
     * pb.redirectInput(Redirect.INHERIT)
     *   .redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
     *   .redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT)
     * }</pre>
     *
     * This gives behavior equivalent to most operating system
     * command interpreters, or the standard C library function
     * {@code system()}.
