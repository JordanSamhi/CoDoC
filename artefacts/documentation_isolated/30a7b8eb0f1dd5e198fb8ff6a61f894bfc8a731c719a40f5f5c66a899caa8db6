     * Combines this date-time with a time-zone to create a {@code ZonedDateTime}
     * ensuring that the result has the same instant.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime} formed from this date-time and the specified time-zone.
     * This conversion will ignore the visible local date-time and use the underlying instant instead.
     * This avoids any problems with local time-line gaps or overlaps.
     * The result might have different values for fields such as hour, minute an even day.
     * <p>
     * To attempt to retain the values of the fields, use {@link #atZoneSimilarLocal(ZoneId)}.
     * To use the offset as the zone ID, use {@link #toZonedDateTime()}.
     *
     * @param zone  the time-zone to use, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time formed from this date-time, not null
