     * Returns the name constraints criterion. The {@code X509Certificate}
     * must have subject and subject alternative names that
     * meet the specified name constraints.
     * <p>
     * The name constraints are returned as a byte array. This byte array
     * contains the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
     * would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 3280
     * and X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
     * documentation for
     * {@link #setNameConstraints(byte [] bytes) setNameConstraints(byte [] bytes)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
     *
     * @return a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
     *         a NameConstraints extension used for checking name constraints.
     *         {@code null} if no name constraints check will be performed.
