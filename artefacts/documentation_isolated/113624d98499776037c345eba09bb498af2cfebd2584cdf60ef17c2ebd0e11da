     * Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
     * creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
     * that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
     * affect the directory. The {@link #createDirectories createDirectories}
     * method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
     * parent directories first.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is optional {@link FileAttribute
     * file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
     * attribute is identified by its {@link FileAttribute#name name}. If more
     * than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
     * the last occurrence is ignored.
     *
     * @param   dir
     *          the directory to create
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the directory
     *
     * @return  the directory
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the directory
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if a directory could not otherwise be created because a file of
     *          that name already exists <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the new directory.
