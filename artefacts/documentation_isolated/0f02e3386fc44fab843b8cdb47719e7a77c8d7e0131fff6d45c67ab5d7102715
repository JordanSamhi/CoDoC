     * Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.
     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code OffsetDateTime}, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
     * The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
     * Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
     * <p>
     * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
     * A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
     * A selection of common adjustments is provided in
     * {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
     * These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
     * Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
     * such as {@link Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
     * The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
     * lengths of month and leap years.
     * <p>
     * For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
     * <pre>
     *  import static java.time.Month.*;
     *  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
     *
     *  result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The classes {@link LocalDate}, {@link LocalTime} and {@link ZoneOffset} implement
     * {@code TemporalAdjuster}, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
     * <pre>
     *  result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
     *  result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
     *  result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
     * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
     * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param adjuster the adjuster to use, not null
     * @return an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on {@code this} with the adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the adjustment cannot be made
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
