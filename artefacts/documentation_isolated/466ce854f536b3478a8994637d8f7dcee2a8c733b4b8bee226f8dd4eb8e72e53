     * Parses the string argument as a signed decimal {@code long}.
     * The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except
     * that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign {@code '-'}
     * ({@code \u005Cu002D'}) to indicate a negative value or an
     * ASCII plus sign {@code '+'} ({@code '\u005Cu002B'}) to
     * indicate a positive value. The resulting {@code long} value is
     * returned, exactly as if the argument and the radix {@code 10}
     * were given as arguments to the {@link
     * #parseLong(java.lang.String, int)} method.
     *
     * <p>Note that neither the character {@code L}
     * ({@code '\u005Cu004C'}) nor {@code l}
     * ({@code '\u005Cu006C'}) is permitted to appear at the end
     * of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in
     * Java programming language source code.
