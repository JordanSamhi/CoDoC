     * Resolves this field to provide a simpler alternative or a date.
     * <p>
     * This method is invoked during the resolve phase of parsing.
     * It is designed to allow application defined fields to be simplified into
     * more standard fields, such as those on {@code ChronoField}, or into a date.
     * <p>
     * Applications should not normally invoke this method directly.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or
     * combined with others, then this method must be implemented.
     * <p>
     * The specified map contains the current state of the parse.
     * The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and
     * any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing
     * if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore
     * assume this field is present.
     * <p>
     * Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,
     * and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a
     * simpler value, such as a {@code ChronoField}, or returning a
     * complete {@code ChronoLocalDate}. If a resolve is successful,
     * the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,
     * including this field.
     * <p>
     * For example, the {@code IsoFields} class contains the quarter-of-year
     * and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class
     * resolves the two fields plus the {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} into a
     * complete {@code LocalDate}. The resolve method will remove all three
     * fields from the map before returning the {@code LocalDate}.
     * <p>
     * A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone
     * to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.
     * Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and
     * must not be relied on.
     * The behavior of other methods such as {@code get}, {@code getLong},
     * {@code range} and {@code isSupported} is unpredictable and the results undefined.
     * <p>
     * If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver
     * style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which
     * may require throwing a {@code DateTimeException} or {@code ArithmeticException}.
     * If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.
     * <p>
     * When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.
     * When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,
     * with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also
     * be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other {@code ChronoField}
     * instances that can produce a date, such as {@code EPOCH_DAY}.
     * <p>
     * Not all {@code TemporalAccessor} implementations are accepted as return values.
     * Implementations that call this method must accept {@code ChronoLocalDate},
     * {@code ChronoLocalDateTime}, {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} and {@code LocalTime}.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation must return null.
     *
     * @param fieldValues  the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
     * @param partialTemporal  the partially complete temporal to query for zone and
     *  chronology; querying for other things is undefined and not recommended, not null
     * @param resolverStyle  the requested type of resolve, not null
     * @return the resolved temporal object; null if resolving only
     *  changed the map, or no resolve occurred
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
     * @throws DateTimeException if resolving results in an error. This must not be thrown
     *  by querying a field on the temporal without first checking if it is supported
