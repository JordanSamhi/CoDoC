     * Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or
     * equal to zero, {@code X509Certificates} must include a
     * basicConstraints extension with
     * a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
     * certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.
     * <p>
     * This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
     * (from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
     * built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
     * than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.
     *
     * @param minMaxPathLen the value for the basic constraints constraint
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the value is less than -2
     * @see #getBasicConstraints
