     * Connects the socket to a remote address for this socket. When a
     * socket is connected to a remote address, packets may only be
     * sent to or received from that address. By default a datagram
     * socket is not connected.
     *
     * <p>If the remote destination to which the socket is connected does not
     * exist, or is otherwise unreachable, and if an ICMP destination unreachable
     * packet has been received for that address, then a subsequent call to
     * send or receive may throw a PortUnreachableException. Note, there is no
     * guarantee that the exception will be thrown.
     *
     * <p> If a security manager has been installed then it is invoked to check
     * access to the remote address. Specifically, if the given {@code address}
     * is a {@link InetAddress#isMulticastAddress multicast address},
     * the security manager's {@link
     * java.lang.SecurityManager#checkMulticast(InetAddress)
     * checkMulticast} method is invoked with the given {@code address}.
     * Otherwise, the security manager's {@link
     * java.lang.SecurityManager#checkConnect(String,int) checkConnect}
     * and {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkAccept checkAccept} methods
     * are invoked, with the given {@code address} and {@code port}, to
     * verify that datagrams are permitted to be sent and received
     * respectively.
     *
     * <p> When a socket is connected, {@link #receive receive} and
     * {@link #send send} <b>will not perform any security checks</b>
     * on incoming and outgoing packets, other than matching the packet's
     * and the socket's address and port. On a send operation, if the
     * packet's address is set and the packet's address and the socket's
     * address do not match, an {@code IllegalArgumentException} will be
     * thrown. A socket connected to a multicast address may only be used
     * to send packets.
     *
     * @param address the remote address for the socket
     *
     * @param port the remote port for the socket.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *         if the address is null, or the port is out of range.
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *         if a security manager has been installed and it does
     *         not permit access to the given remote address
