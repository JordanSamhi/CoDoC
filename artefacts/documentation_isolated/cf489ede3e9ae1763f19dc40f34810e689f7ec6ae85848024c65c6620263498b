     * Checks if the instant of this date-time is before that of the specified date-time.
     * <p>
     * This method differs from the comparison in {@link #compareTo} in that it
     * only compares the instant of the date-time. This is equivalent to using
     * {@code dateTime1.toInstant().isBefore(dateTime2.toInstant());}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this is before the instant of the specified date-time
