     * Loads the native library specified by the <code>libname</code>
     * argument.  The <code>libname</code> argument must not contain any platform
     * specific prefix, file extension or path. If a native library
     * called <code>libname</code> is statically linked with the VM, then the
     * JNI_OnLoad_<code>libname</code> function exported by the library is invoked.
     * See the JNI Specification for more details.
     *
     * Otherwise, the libname argument is loaded from a system library
     * location and mapped to a native library image in an implementation-
     * dependent manner.
     * <p>
     * First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkLink</code>
     * method is called with the <code>libname</code> as its argument.
     * This may result in a security exception.
     * <p>
     * The method {@link System#loadLibrary(String)} is the conventional
     * and convenient means of invoking this method. If native
     * methods are to be used in the implementation of a class, a standard
     * strategy is to put the native code in a library file (call it
     * <code>LibFile</code>) and then to put a static initializer:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * static { System.loadLibrary("LibFile"); }
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * within the class declaration. When the class is loaded and
     * initialized, the necessary native code implementation for the native
     * methods will then be loaded as well.
     * <p>
     * If this method is called more than once with the same library
     * name, the second and subsequent calls are ignored.
     *
     * @param      libname   the name of the library.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             <code>checkLink</code> method doesn't allow
     *             loading of the specified dynamic library
     * @exception  UnsatisfiedLinkError if either the libname argument
     *             contains a file path, the native library is not statically
     *             linked with the VM,  or the library cannot be mapped to a
     *             native library image by the host system.
     * @exception  NullPointerException if <code>libname</code> is
     *             <code>null</code>
