     * Returns a <tt>Character</tt> instance representing the specified
     * <tt>char</tt> value.
     * If a new <tt>Character</tt> instance is not required, this method
     * should generally be used in preference to the constructor
     * {@link #Character(char)}, as this method is likely to yield
     * significantly better space and time performance by caching
     * frequently requested values.
     *
     * This method will always cache values in the range {@code
     * '\u005Cu0000'} to {@code '\u005Cu007F'}, inclusive, and may
     * cache other values outside of this range.
     *
     * @param  c a char value.
     * @return a <tt>Character</tt> instance representing <tt>c</tt>.
