     * Permits an application to erase its own data from disk.  This is equivalent to
     * the user choosing to clear the app's data from within the device settings UI.  It
     * erases all dynamic data associated with the app -- its private data and data in its
     * private area on external storage -- but does not remove the installed application
     * itself, nor any OBB files. It also revokes all runtime permissions that the app has acquired,
     * clears all notifications and removes all Uri grants related to this application.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the application successfully requested that the application's
     *     data be erased; {@code false} otherwise.
