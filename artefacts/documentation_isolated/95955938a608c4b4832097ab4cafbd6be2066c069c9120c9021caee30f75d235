     * ByteArrayInputStream objects are marked at position zero by
     * default when constructed.  They may be marked at another
     * position within the buffer by this method.
     * <p>
     * If no mark has been set, then the value of the mark is the
     * offset passed to the constructor (or 0 if the offset was not
     * supplied).
     *
     * <p> Note: The <code>readAheadLimit</code> for this class
     *  has no meaning.
