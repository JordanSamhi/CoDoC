     * Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but
     * will reuse previously constructed threads when they are
     * available.  These pools will typically improve the performance
     * of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks.
     * Calls to {@code execute} will reuse previously constructed
     * threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a new
     * thread will be created and added to the pool. Threads that have
     * not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from
     * the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will
     * not consume any resources. Note that pools with similar
     * properties but different details (for example, timeout parameters)
     * may be created using {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} constructors.

     * @return the newly created thread pool
