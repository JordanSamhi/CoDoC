     * Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
     * (images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
     * that is independent of the location of the code.
     *
     * <p>The name of a resource is a <tt>/</tt>-separated path name that
     * identifies the resource.
     *
     * <p> The search order is described in the documentation for {@link

     * @apiNote When overriding this method it is recommended that an
     * implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the {@link
     * #getResource(java.lang.String) getResource(String)} method. This should
     * ensure that the first element returned by the Enumeration's
     * {@code nextElement} method is the same resource that the
     * {@code getResource(String)} method would return.
     *
     * @param  name
     *         The resource name
     *
     * @return  An enumeration of {@link java.net.URL <tt>URL</tt>} objects for
     *          the resource.  If no resources could  be found, the enumeration
     *          will be empty.  Resources that the class loader doesn't have
     *          access to will not be in the enumeration.
