     * Creates a {@link Spliterator} over the elements in this collection.
     *
     * Implementations should document characteristic values reported by the
     * spliterator.  Such characteristic values are not required to be reported
     * if the spliterator reports {@link Spliterator#SIZED} and this collection
     * contains no elements.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation should be overridden by subclasses that
     * can return a more efficient spliterator.  In order to
     * preserve expected laziness behavior for the {@link #stream()} and
     * {@link #parallelStream()}} methods, spliterators should either have the
     * characteristic of {@code IMMUTABLE} or {@code CONCURRENT}, or be
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>.
     * If none of these is practical, the overriding class should describe the
     * spliterator's documented policy of binding and structural interference,
     * and should override the {@link #stream()} and {@link #parallelStream()}
     * methods to create streams using a {@code Supplier} of the spliterator,
     * as in:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Stream<E> s = StreamSupport.stream(() -> spliterator(), spliteratorCharacteristics)
     * }</pre>
     * <p>These requirements ensure that streams produced by the
     * {@link #stream()} and {@link #parallelStream()} methods will reflect the
     * contents of the collection as of initiation of the terminal stream
     * operation.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation creates a
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em> spliterator
     * from the collections's {@code Iterator}.  The spliterator inherits the
     * <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the collection's iterator.
     * <p>
     * The created {@code Spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#SIZED}.
     *
     * @implNote
     * The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link Spliterator#SUBSIZED}.
     *
     * <p>If a spliterator covers no elements then the reporting of additional
     * characteristic values, beyond that of {@code SIZED} and {@code SUBSIZED},
     * does not aid clients to control, specialize or simplify computation.
     * However, this does enable shared use of an immutable and empty
     * spliterator instance (see {@link Spliterators#emptySpliterator()}) for
     * empty collections, and enables clients to determine if such a spliterator
     * covers no elements.
