     * Returns a hexadecimal string representation of the
     * {@code float} argument. All characters mentioned below are
     * ASCII characters.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the argument is NaN, the result is the string
     *     "{@code NaN}".
     * <li>Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
     * magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative,
     * the first character of the result is '{@code -}'
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002D'}); if the sign is positive, no sign character
     * appears in the result. As for the magnitude <i>m</i>:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is infinity, it is represented by the string
     * {@code "Infinity"}; thus, positive infinity produces the
     * result {@code "Infinity"} and negative infinity produces
     * the result {@code "-Infinity"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is zero, it is represented by the string
     * {@code "0x0.0p0"}; thus, negative zero produces the result
     * {@code "-0x0.0p0"} and positive zero produces the result
     * {@code "0x0.0p0"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is a {@code float} value with a
     * normalized representation, substrings are used to represent the
     * significand and exponent fields.  The significand is
     * represented by the characters {@code "0x1."}
     * followed by a lowercase hexadecimal representation of the rest
     * of the significand as a fraction.  Trailing zeros in the
     * hexadecimal representation are removed unless all the digits
     * are zero, in which case a single zero is used. Next, the
     * exponent is represented by {@code "p"} followed
     * by a decimal string of the unbiased exponent as if produced by
     * a call to {@link Integer#toString(int) Integer.toString} on the
     * exponent value.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is a {@code float} value with a subnormal
     * representation, the significand is represented by the
     * characters {@code "0x0."} followed by a
     * hexadecimal representation of the rest of the significand as a
     * fraction.  Trailing zeros in the hexadecimal representation are
     * removed. Next, the exponent is represented by
     * {@code "p-126"}.  Note that there must be at
     * least one nonzero digit in a subnormal significand.
     *
     * </ul>
