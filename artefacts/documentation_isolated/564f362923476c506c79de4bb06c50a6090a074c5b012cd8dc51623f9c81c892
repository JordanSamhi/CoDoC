     * Enable or disable finalization on exit; doing so specifies that the
     * finalizers of all objects that have finalizers that have not yet been
     * automatically invoked are to be run before the Java runtime exits.
     * By default, finalization on exit is disabled.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager,
     * its <code>checkExit</code> method is first called
     * with 0 as its argument to ensure the exit is allowed.
     * This could result in a SecurityException.
     *
     * @param value true to enable finalization on exit, false to disable
     * @deprecated  This method is inherently unsafe.  It may result in
     *      finalizers being called on live objects while other threads are
     *      concurrently manipulating those objects, resulting in erratic
     *      behavior or deadlock.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *        if a security manager exists and its <code>checkExit</code>
     *        method doesn't allow the exit.
