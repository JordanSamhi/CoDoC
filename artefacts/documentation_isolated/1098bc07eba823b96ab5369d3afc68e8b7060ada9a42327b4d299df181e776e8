     * Returns an empty {@code Optional} instance.  No value is present for this
     * Optional.

     * @apiNote Though it may be tempting to do so, avoid testing if an object
     * is empty by comparing with {@code ==} against instances returned by
     * {@code Option.empty()}. There is no guarantee that it is a singleton.
     * Instead, use {@link #isPresent()}.
