     * Skips input that matches the specified pattern, ignoring delimiters.
     * This method will skip input if an anchored match of the specified
     * pattern succeeds.
     *
     * <p>If a match to the specified pattern is not found at the
     * current position, then no input is skipped and a
     * <tt>NoSuchElementException</tt> is thrown.
     *
     * <p>Since this method seeks to match the specified pattern starting at
     * the scanner's current position, patterns that can match a lot of
     * input (".*", for example) may cause the scanner to buffer a large
     * amount of input.
     *
     * <p>Note that it is possible to skip something without risking a
     * <code>NoSuchElementException</code> by using a pattern that can
     * match nothing, e.g., <code>sc.skip("[ \t]*")</code>.
     *
     * @param pattern a string specifying the pattern to skip over
     * @return this scanner
     * @throws NoSuchElementException if the specified pattern is not found
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this scanner is closed
