     * Appends the localized zone offset, such as 'GMT+01:00', to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This appends a localized zone offset to the builder, the format of the
     * localized offset is controlled by the specified {@link FormatStyle style}
     * to this method:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link TextStyle#FULL full} - formats with localized offset text, such
     * as 'GMT, 2-digit hour and minute field, optional second field if non-zero,
     * and colon.
     * <li>{@link TextStyle#SHORT short} - formats with localized offset text,
     * such as 'GMT, hour without leading zero, optional 2-digit minute and
     * second if non-zero, and colon.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * During formatting, the offset is obtained using a mechanism equivalent
     * to querying the temporal with {@link TemporalQueries#offset()}.
     * If the offset cannot be obtained then an exception is thrown unless the
     * section of the formatter is optional.
     * <p>
     * During parsing, the offset is parsed using the format defined above.
     * If the offset cannot be parsed then an exception is thrown unless the
     * section of the formatter is optional.
     * <p>
     * @param style  the format style to use, not null
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if style is neither {@link TextStyle#FULL
     * full} nor {@link TextStyle#SHORT short}
