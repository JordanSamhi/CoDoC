     * The error method is called when a Handler failure occurs.
     * <p>
     * This method may be overridden in subclasses.  The default
     * behavior in this base class is that the first call is
     * reported to System.err, and subsequent calls are ignored.
     *
     * @param msg    a descriptive string (may be null)
     * @param ex     an exception (may be null)
     * @param code   an error code defined in ErrorManager
