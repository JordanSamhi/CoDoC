     * Queries whether the given thread is waiting to acquire this
     * lock. Note that because cancellations may occur at any time, a
     * {@code true} return does not guarantee that this thread
     * will ever acquire this lock.  This method is designed primarily for use
     * in monitoring of the system state.
     *
     * @param thread the thread
     * @return {@code true} if the given thread is queued waiting for this lock
     * @throws NullPointerException if the thread is null
