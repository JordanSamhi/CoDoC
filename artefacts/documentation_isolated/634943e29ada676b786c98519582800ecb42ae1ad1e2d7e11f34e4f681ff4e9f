         * Returns the UnicodeBlock with the given name. Block
         * names are determined by The Unicode Standard. The file
         * Blocks-&lt;version&gt;.txt defines blocks for a particular
         * version of the standard. The {@link Character} class specifies
         * the version of the standard that it supports.
         * <p>
         * This method accepts block names in the following forms:
         * <ol>
         * <li> Canonical block names as defined by the Unicode Standard.
         * For example, the standard defines a "Basic Latin" block. Therefore, this
         * method accepts "Basic Latin" as a valid block name. The documentation of
         * each UnicodeBlock provides the canonical name.
         * <li>Canonical block names with all spaces removed. For example, "BasicLatin"
         * is a valid block name for the "Basic Latin" block.
         * <li>The text representation of each constant UnicodeBlock identifier.
         * For example, this method will return the {@link #BASIC_LATIN} block if
         * provided with the "BASIC_LATIN" name. This form replaces all spaces and
         * hyphens in the canonical name with underscores.
         * </ol>
         * Finally, character case is ignored for all of the valid block name forms.
         * For example, "BASIC_LATIN" and "basic_latin" are both valid block names.
         * The en_US locale's case mapping rules are used to provide case-insensitive
         * string comparisons for block name validation.
         * <p>
         * If the Unicode Standard changes block names, both the previous and
         * current names will be accepted.
