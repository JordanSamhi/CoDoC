     * Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
     * write bytes to the file. This method works in exactly the manner
     * specified by the {@link Files#newOutputStream} method.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method opens a channel to the file
     * as if by invoking the {@link #newByteChannel} method and constructs a
     * stream that writes bytes to the channel. This method should be overridden
     * where appropriate.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new output stream
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if {@code options} contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete} method is
     *          invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the
     *          {@code DELETE_ON_CLOSE} option.
