     * Returns a composed predicate that represents a short-circuiting logical
     * OR of this predicate and another.  When evaluating the composed
     * predicate, if this predicate is {@code true}, then the {@code other}
     * predicate is not evaluated.
     *
     * <p>Any exceptions thrown during evaluation of either predicate are relayed
     * to the caller; if evaluation of this predicate throws an exception, the
     * {@code other} predicate will not be evaluated.
     *
     * @param other a predicate that will be logically-ORed with this
     *              predicate
     * @return a composed predicate that represents the short-circuiting logical
     * OR of this predicate and the {@code other} predicate
     * @throws NullPointerException if other is null
