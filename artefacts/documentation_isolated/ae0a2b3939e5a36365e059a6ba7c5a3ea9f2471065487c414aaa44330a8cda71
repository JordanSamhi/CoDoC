     * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
     * int} values, each conforming to the given origin (inclusive) and bound
     * (exclusive).
     *
     * <p>A pseudorandom {@code int} value is generated as if it's the result of
     * calling the following method with the origin and bound:
     * <pre> {@code
     * int nextInt(int origin, int bound) {
     *   int n = bound - origin;
     *   if (n > 0) {
     *     return nextInt(n) + origin;
     *   }
     *   else {  // range not representable as int
     *     int r;
     *     do {
     *       r = nextInt();
     *     } while (r < origin || r >= bound);
     *     return r;
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @implNote This method is implemented to be equivalent to {@code
     * ints(Long.MAX_VALUE, randomNumberOrigin, randomNumberBound)}.
     *
     * @param randomNumberOrigin the origin (inclusive) of each random value
     * @param randomNumberBound the bound (exclusive) of each random value
     * @return a stream of pseudorandom {@code int} values,
     *         each with the given origin (inclusive) and bound (exclusive)
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code randomNumberOrigin}
     *         is greater than or equal to {@code randomNumberBound}
