     * The return value is unspecified if this pathname denotes a directory.

     * <p> Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
     * that {@code 0L} is returned, or where several attributes of the same file
     * are required at the same time, then the {@link

     *
     * @return  The length, in bytes, of the file denoted by this abstract
     *          pathname, or <code>0L</code> if the file does not exist.  Some
     *          operating systems may return <code>0L</code> for pathnames
     *          denoting system-dependent entities such as devices or pipes.
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkRead(java.lang.String)}</code>
     *          method denies read access to the file
