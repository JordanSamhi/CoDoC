     * Returns the sum of values recorded, or zero if no values have been
     * recorded.
     *
     * If any recorded value is a NaN or the sum is at any point a NaN
     * then the sum will be NaN.
     *
     * <p> The value of a floating-point sum is a function both of the
     * input values as well as the order of addition operations. The
     * order of addition operations of this method is intentionally
     * not defined to allow for implementation flexibility to improve
     * the speed and accuracy of the computed result.
     *
     * In particular, this method may be implemented using compensated
     * summation or other technique to reduce the error bound in the
     * numerical sum compared to a simple summation of {@code double}
     * values.
     *
     * @apiNote Values sorted by increasing absolute magnitude tend to yield
     * more accurate results.
     *
     * @return the sum of values, or zero if none
