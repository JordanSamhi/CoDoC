     * Returns an array of {@code Constructor} objects reflecting all the
     * constructors declared by the class represented by this
     * {@code Class} object. These are public, protected, default
     * (package) access, and private constructors.  The elements in the array
     * returned are not sorted and are not in any particular order.  If the
     * class has a default constructor, it is included in the returned array.
     * This method returns an array of length 0 if this {@code Class}
     * object represents an interface, a primitive type, an array class, or
     * void.
