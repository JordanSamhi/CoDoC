     * Log a message, specifying source class, method, and resource bundle,
     * with associated Throwable information.
     * <p>
     * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message
     * level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord
     * which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.
     * <p>
     * The {@code msg} string is localized using the given resource bundle.
     * If the resource bundle is {@code null}, then the {@code msg} string is not
     * localized.
     * <p>
     * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
     * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus it is
     * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
     * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
     * <p>
     * @param   level   One of the message level identifiers, e.g., SEVERE
     * @param   sourceClass    Name of the class that issued the logging request
     * @param   sourceMethod   Name of the method that issued the logging request
     * @param   bundle         Resource bundle to localize {@code msg},
     *                         can be {@code null}
     * @param   msg     The string message (or a key in the message catalog)
     * @param   thrown  Throwable associated with the log message.
