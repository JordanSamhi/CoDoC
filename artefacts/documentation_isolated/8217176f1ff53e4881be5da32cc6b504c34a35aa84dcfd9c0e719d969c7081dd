     * Constructs a writer that encodes characters according to the named
     * charset and writes the resulting bytes to the given channel.
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method of the form
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Channels.newWriter(ch, csname)</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * behaves in exactly the same way as the expression
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * Channels.newWriter(ch,
     *                    Charset.forName(csName)
     *                        .newEncoder(),
     *                    -1);</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel to which bytes will be written
     *
     * @param  csName
     *         The name of the charset to be used
     *
     * @return  A new writer
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedCharsetException
     *          If no support for the named charset is available
     *          in this instance of the Java virtual machine
