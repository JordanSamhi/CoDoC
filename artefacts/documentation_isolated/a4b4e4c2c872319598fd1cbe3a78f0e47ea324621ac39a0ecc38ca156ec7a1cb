    * Retrieves the unique {@link java.io.Reader Reader} object associated
    * with this console.
    * <p>
    * This method is intended to be used by sophisticated applications, for
    * example, a {@link java.util.Scanner} object which utilizes the rich
    * parsing/scanning functionality provided by the <tt>Scanner</tt>:
    * <blockquote><pre>
    * Console con = System.console();
    * if (con != null) {
    *     Scanner sc = new Scanner(con.reader());
    *     ...
    * }
    * </pre></blockquote>
    * <p>
    * For simple applications requiring only line-oriented reading, use
    * <tt>{@link #readLine}</tt>.
    * <p>
    * The bulk read operations {@link java.io.Reader#read(char[]) read(char[]) },
    * {@link java.io.Reader#read(char[], int, int) read(char[], int, int) } and
    * {@link java.io.Reader#read(java.nio.CharBuffer) read(java.nio.CharBuffer)}
    * on the returned object will not read in characters beyond the line
    * bound for each invocation, even if the destination buffer has space for
    * more characters. The {@code Reader}'s {@code read} methods may block if a
    * line bound has not been entered or reached on the console's input device.
    * A line bound is considered to be any one of a line feed (<tt>'\n'</tt>),
    * a carriage return (<tt>'\r'</tt>), a carriage return followed immediately
    * by a linefeed, or an end of stream.
    *
    * @return  The reader associated with this console
