     * Gets the number of seconds in this duration.
     * <p>
     * The length of the duration is stored using two fields - seconds and nanoseconds.
     * The nanoseconds part is a value from 0 to 999,999,999 that is an adjustment to
     * the length in seconds.
     * The total duration is defined by calling this method and {@link #getNano()}.
     * <p>
     * A {@code Duration} represents a directed distance between two points on the time-line.
     * A negative duration is expressed by the negative sign of the seconds part.
     * A duration of -1 nanosecond is stored as -1 seconds plus 999,999,999 nanoseconds.
     *
     * @return the whole seconds part of the length of the duration, positive or negative
