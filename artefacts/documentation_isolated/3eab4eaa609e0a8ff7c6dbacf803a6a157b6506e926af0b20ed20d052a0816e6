     * Sets the general request property. If a property with the key already
     * exists, overwrite its value with the new value.
     *
     * <p> NOTE: HTTP requires all request properties which can
     * legally have multiple instances with the same key
     * to use a comma-separated list syntax which enables multiple
     * properties to be appended into a single property.
     *
     * @param   key     the keyword by which the request is known
     *                  (e.g., "{@code Accept}").
     * @param   value   the value associated with it.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if already connected
     * @throws NullPointerException if key is <CODE>null</CODE>
