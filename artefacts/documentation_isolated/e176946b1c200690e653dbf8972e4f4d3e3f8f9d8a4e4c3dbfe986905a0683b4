     * Removes the specified element from this set if it is present.
     * More formally, removes an element {@code e} such that
     * {@code Objects.equals(o, e)}, if this set contains such an element.
     * Returns {@code true} if this set contained the element (or
     * equivalently, if this set changed as a result of the call).
     * (This set will not contain the element once the call returns.)
     *
     * @param o object to be removed from this set, if present
