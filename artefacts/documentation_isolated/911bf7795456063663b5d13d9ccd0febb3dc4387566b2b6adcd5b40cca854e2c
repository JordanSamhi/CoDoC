     * Enables/Disables tracing of instructions.
     * If the <code>boolean</code> argument is <code>true</code>, this
     * method suggests that the Java virtual machine emit debugging
     * information for each instruction in the virtual machine as it
     * is executed. The format of this information, and the file or other
     * output stream to which it is emitted, depends on the host environment.
     * The virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support
     * this feature. The destination of the trace output is system
     * dependent.
     * <p>
     * If the <code>boolean</code> argument is <code>false</code>, this
     * method causes the virtual machine to stop performing the
     * detailed instruction trace it is performing.
     *
     * @param   on   <code>true</code> to enable instruction tracing;
     *               <code>false</code> to disable this feature.
