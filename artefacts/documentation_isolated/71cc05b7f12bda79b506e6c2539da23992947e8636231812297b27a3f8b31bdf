     * Returns a string representation of this bit set. For every index
     * for which this {@code BitSet} contains a bit in the set
     * state, the decimal representation of that index is included in
     * the result. Such indices are listed in order from lowest to
     * highest, separated by ",&nbsp;" (a comma and a space) and
     * surrounded by braces, resulting in the usual mathematical
     * notation for a set of integers.
     *
     * <p>Example:
     * <pre>
     * BitSet drPepper = new BitSet();</pre>
     * Now {@code drPepper.toString()} returns "{@code {}}".
     * <pre>
     * drPepper.set(2);</pre>
     * Now {@code drPepper.toString()} returns "{@code {2}}".
     * <pre>
     * drPepper.set(4);
     * drPepper.set(10);</pre>
     * Now {@code drPepper.toString()} returns "{@code {2, 4, 10}}".
     *
     * @return a string representation of this bit set
