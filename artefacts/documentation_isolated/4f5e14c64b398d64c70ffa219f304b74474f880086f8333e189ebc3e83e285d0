     * Creates a {@code Spliterator} over the elements in this sorted set.
     *
     * <p>The {@code Spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#DISTINCT},
     * {@link Spliterator#SORTED} and {@link Spliterator#ORDERED}.
     * Implementations should document the reporting of additional
     * characteristic values.
     *
     * <p>The spliterator's comparator (see
     * {@link java.util.Spliterator#getComparator()}) must be {@code null} if
     * the sorted set's comparator (see {@link #comparator()}) is {@code null}.
     * Otherwise, the spliterator's comparator must be the same as or impose the
     * same total ordering as the sorted set's comparator.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation creates a
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em> spliterator
     * from the sorted set's {@code Iterator}.  The spliterator inherits the
     * <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the set's iterator.  The
     * spliterator's comparator is the same as the sorted set's comparator.
     * <p>
     * The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link Spliterator#SIZED}.
     *
     * @implNote
     * The created {@code Spliterator} additionally reports
     * {@link Spliterator#SUBSIZED}.
