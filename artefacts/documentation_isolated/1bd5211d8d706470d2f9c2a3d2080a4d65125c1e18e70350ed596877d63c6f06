     * Returns a copy of this {@code OffsetDateTime} with the specified offset ensuring
     * that the result has the same local date-time.
     * <p>
     * This method returns an object with the same {@code LocalDateTime} and the specified {@code ZoneOffset}.
     * No calculation is needed or performed.
     * For example, if this time represents {@code 2007-12-03T10:30+02:00} and the offset specified is
     * {@code +03:00}, then this method will return {@code 2007-12-03T10:30+03:00}.
     * <p>
     * To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
     * use {@link #withOffsetSameInstant}.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param offset  the zone offset to change to, not null
     * @return an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested offset, not null
