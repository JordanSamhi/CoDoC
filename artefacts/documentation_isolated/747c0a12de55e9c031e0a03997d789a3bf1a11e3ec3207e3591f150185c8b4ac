     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
     * symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
     * of the link is read. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS
     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.
     *
     * <p> Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case
     * that the file is not a directory then the file attributes can be
     * read with the {@link #readAttributes(Path,Class,LinkOption[])
     * readAttributes} method and the file type tested with the {@link
     * BasicFileAttributes#isDirectory} method.

     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to test
     * @param   options
     *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file is a directory; {@code false} if
     *          the file does not exist, is not a directory, or it cannot
     *          be determined if the file is a directory or not.

     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file.
