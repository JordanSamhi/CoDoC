     * <p>Filters objects against the <code>ANDROID_OBJECT_FILTER</code>
     * environment variable. This environment variable can filter objects
     * based on their class name and attribute values.</p>
     *
     * <p>Here is the syntax for <code>ANDROID_OBJECT_FILTER</code>:</p>
     *
     * <p><code>ClassName@attribute1=value1@attribute2=value2...</code></p>
     *
     * <p>Examples:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Select TextView instances: <code>TextView</code></li>
     * <li>Select TextView instances of text "Loading" and bottom offset of 22:
     * <code>TextView@text=Loading.*@bottom=22</code></li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The class name and the values are regular expressions.</p>
     *
     * <p>This class is useful for debugging and logging purpose:</p>
     * <pre>
     * if (DEBUG) {
     *   if (DebugUtils.isObjectSelected(childView) && LOGV_ENABLED) {
     *     Log.v(TAG, "Object " + childView + " logged!");
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This method is very expensive as it relies
     * heavily on regular expressions and reflection. Calls to this method
     * should always be stripped out of the release binaries and avoided
     * as much as possible in debug mode.</p>
     *
     * @param object any object to match against the ANDROID_OBJECT_FILTER
     *        environement variable
     * @return true if object is selected by the ANDROID_OBJECT_FILTER
     *         environment variable, false otherwise
