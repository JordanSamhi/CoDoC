     * Creates an unresolved socket address from a hostname and a port number.
     * <p>
     * No attempt will be made to resolve the hostname into an InetAddress.
     * The address will be flagged as <I>unresolved</I>.
     * <p>
     * A valid port value is between 0 and 65535.
     * A port number of {@code zero} will let the system pick up an
     * ephemeral port in a {@code bind} operation.
     * <P>
     * @param   host    the Host name
     * @param   port    The port number
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the port parameter is outside
     *                  the range of valid port values, or if the hostname
     *                  parameter is <TT>null</TT>.
     * @see     #isUnresolved()
