     * Creates a new sequential or parallel {@code Stream} from a
     * {@code Spliterator}.
     *
     * <p>The spliterator is only traversed, split, or queried for estimated
     * size after the terminal operation of the stream pipeline commences.
     *
     * <p>It is strongly recommended the spliterator report a characteristic of
     * {@code IMMUTABLE} or {@code CONCURRENT}, or be
     * <a href="../Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a>.  Otherwise,
     * {@link #stream(java.util.function.Supplier, int, boolean)} should be used
     * to reduce the scope of potential interference with the source.  See
     * <a href="package-summary.html#NonInterference">Non-Interference</a> for
     * more details.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of stream elements
     * @param spliterator a {@code Spliterator} describing the stream elements
     * @param parallel if {@code true} then the returned stream is a parallel
     *        stream; if {@code false} the returned stream is a sequential
     *        stream.
     * @return a new sequential or parallel {@code Stream}
