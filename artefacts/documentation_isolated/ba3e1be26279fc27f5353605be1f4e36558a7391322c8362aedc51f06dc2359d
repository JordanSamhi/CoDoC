         * Resets the Builder to match the provided IETF BCP 47
         * language tag.  Discards the existing state.  Null and the
         * empty string cause the builder to be reset, like {@link
         * #clear}.  Grandfathered tags (see {@link
         * Locale#forLanguageTag}) are converted to their canonical
         * form before being processed.  Otherwise, the language tag
         * must be well-formed (see {@link Locale}) or an exception is
         * thrown (unlike <code>Locale.forLanguageTag</code>, which
         * just discards ill-formed and following portions of the
         * tag).
         *
         * @param languageTag the language tag
         * @return This builder.
         * @throws IllformedLocaleException if <code>languageTag</code> is ill-formed
