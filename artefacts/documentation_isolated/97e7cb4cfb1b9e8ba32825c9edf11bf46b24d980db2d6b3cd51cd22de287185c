     * Obtains a {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} in this chronology from another temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a zoned date-time in this chronology based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code ChronoZonedDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion will first obtain a {@code ZoneId} from the temporal object,
     * falling back to a {@code ZoneOffset} if necessary. It will then try to obtain
     * an {@code Instant}, falling back to a {@code ChronoLocalDateTime} if necessary.
     * The result will be either the combination of {@code ZoneId} or {@code ZoneOffset}
     * with {@code Instant} or {@code ChronoLocalDateTime}.
     * Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
     * those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
     * The result uses this chronology.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code aChronology::zonedDateTime}.
