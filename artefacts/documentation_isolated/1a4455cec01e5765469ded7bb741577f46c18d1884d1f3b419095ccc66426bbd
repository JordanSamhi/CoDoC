     * Appends the specified {@code StringBuffer} to this sequence.
     * <p>
     * The characters of the {@code StringBuffer} argument are appended,
     * in order, to the contents of this {@code StringBuffer}, increasing the
     * length of this {@code StringBuffer} by the length of the argument.
     * If {@code sb} is {@code null}, then the four characters
     * {@code "null"} are appended to this {@code StringBuffer}.
     * <p>
     * Let <i>n</i> be the length of the old character sequence, the one
     * contained in the {@code StringBuffer} just prior to execution of the
     * {@code append} method. Then the character at index <i>k</i> in
     * the new character sequence is equal to the character at index <i>k</i>
     * in the old character sequence, if <i>k</i> is less than <i>n</i>;
     * otherwise, it is equal to the character at index <i>k-n</i> in the
     * argument {@code sb}.
     * <p>
     * This method synchronizes on {@code this}, the destination
     * object, but does not synchronize on the source ({@code sb}).
     *
     * @param   sb   the {@code StringBuffer} to append.
     * @return  a reference to this object.
