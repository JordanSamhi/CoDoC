     * Returns an infinite sequential ordered {@code LongStream} produced by iterative
     * application of a function {@code f} to an initial element {@code seed},
     * producing a {@code Stream} consisting of {@code seed}, {@code f(seed)},
     * {@code f(f(seed))}, etc.
     *
     * <p>The first element (position {@code 0}) in the {@code LongStream} will
     * be the provided {@code seed}.  For {@code n > 0}, the element at position
     * {@code n}, will be the result of applying the function {@code f} to the
     * element at position {@code n - 1}.
     *
     * @param seed the initial element
     * @param f a function to be applied to to the previous element to produce
     *          a new element
     * @return a new sequential {@code LongStream}
