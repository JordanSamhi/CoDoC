     * Returns a locale specific time format for the ISO chronology.
     * <p>
     * This returns a formatter that will format or parse a time.
     * The exact format pattern used varies by locale.
     * <p>
     * The locale is determined from the formatter. The formatter returned directly by
     * this method will use the {@link Locale#getDefault(Locale.Category) default FORMAT locale}.
     * The locale can be controlled using {@link DateTimeFormatter#withLocale(Locale) withLocale(Locale)}
     * on the result of this method.
     * <p>
     * Note that the localized pattern is looked up lazily.
     * This {@code DateTimeFormatter} holds the style required and the locale,
     * looking up the pattern required on demand.
     * <p>
     * The returned formatter has a chronology of ISO set to ensure dates in
     * other calendar systems are correctly converted.
     * It has no override zone and uses the {@link ResolverStyle#SMART SMART} resolver style.
     *
     * @param timeStyle  the formatter style to obtain, not null
     * @return the time formatter, not null
