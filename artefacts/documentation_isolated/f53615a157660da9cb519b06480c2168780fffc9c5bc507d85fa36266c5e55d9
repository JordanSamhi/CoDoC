     * A lenient query for the {@code ZoneId}, falling back to the {@code ZoneOffset}.
     * <p>
     * This queries a {@code TemporalAccessor} for the zone.
     * It first tries to obtain the zone, using {@link #zoneId()}.
     * If that is not found it tries to obtain the {@link #offset()}.
     * Thus a {@link java.time.ZonedDateTime} will return the result of {@code getZone()},
     * while an {@link java.time.OffsetDateTime} will return the result of {@code getOffset()}.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, applications should use this query rather than {@code #zoneId()}.
     * <p>
     * The method {@link ZoneId#from(TemporalAccessor)} can be used as a
     * {@code TemporalQuery} via a method reference, {@code ZoneId::from}.
     * That method is equivalent to this query, except that it throws an
     * exception if a zone cannot be obtained.
     *
     * @return a query that can obtain the zone ID or offset of a temporal, not null
