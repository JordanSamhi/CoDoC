     * If this task does not have a completer, invokes {@link
     * ForkJoinTask#quietlyComplete} and returns {@code null}.  Or, if
     * the completer's pending count is non-zero, decrements that
     * pending count and returns {@code null}.  Otherwise, returns the
     * completer.  This method can be used as part of a completion
     * traversal loop for homogeneous task hierarchies:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * for (CountedCompleter<?> c = firstComplete();
     *      c != null;
     *      c = c.nextComplete()) {
     *   // ... process c ...
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * @return the completer, or {@code null} if none
