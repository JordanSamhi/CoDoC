     * Sets the client socket implementation factory for the
     * application. The factory can be specified only once.
     * <p>
     * When an application creates a new client socket, the socket
     * implementation factory's {@code createSocketImpl} method is
     * called to create the actual socket implementation.
     * <p>
     * Passing {@code null} to the method is a no-op unless the factory
     * was already set.
     * <p>If there is a security manager, this method first calls
     * the security manager's {@code checkSetFactory} method
     * to ensure the operation is allowed.
     * This could result in a SecurityException.
     *
     * @param      fac   the desired factory.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs when setting the
     *               socket factory.
     * @exception  SocketException  if the factory is already defined.
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
     *             {@code checkSetFactory} method doesn't allow the operation.
