     * Returns an array containing all installed providers that satisfy the
     * specified selection criterion, or null if no such providers have been
     * installed. The returned providers are ordered
     * according to their
     * {@linkplain #insertProviderAt(java.security.Provider, int) preference order}.
     *
     * <p> A cryptographic service is always associated with a particular
     * algorithm or type. For example, a digital signature service is
     * always associated with a particular algorithm (e.g., DSA),
     * and a CertificateFactory service is always associated with
     * a particular certificate type (e.g., X.509).
     *
     * <p>The selection criterion must be specified in one of the following two
     * formats:
     * <ul>
     * <li> <i>{@literal <crypto_service>.<algorithm_or_type>}</i>
     * <p> The cryptographic service name must not contain any dots.
     * <p> A
     * provider satisfies the specified selection criterion iff the provider
     * implements the
     * specified algorithm or type for the specified cryptographic service.
     * <p> For example, "CertificateFactory.X.509"
     * would be satisfied by any provider that supplied
     * a CertificateFactory implementation for X.509 certificates.
     * <li> <i>{@literal <crypto_service>.<algorithm_or_type>
     * <attribute_name>:<attribute_value>}</i>
     * <p> The cryptographic service name must not contain any dots. There
     * must be one or more space characters between the
     * <i>{@literal <algorithm_or_type>}</i> and the
     * <i>{@literal <attribute_name>}</i>.
     *  <p> A provider satisfies this selection criterion iff the
     * provider implements the specified algorithm or type for the specified
     * cryptographic service and its implementation meets the
     * constraint expressed by the specified attribute name/value pair.
     * <p> For example, "Signature.SHA1withDSA KeySize:1024" would be
     * satisfied by any provider that implemented
     * the SHA1withDSA signature algorithm with a keysize of 1024 (or larger).
     *
     * </ul>
