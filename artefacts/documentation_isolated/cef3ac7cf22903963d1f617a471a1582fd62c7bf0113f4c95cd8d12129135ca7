     * Returns a concurrent {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a
     * {@code ConcurrentMap} whose keys and values are the result of applying
     * the provided mapping functions to the input elements.
     *
     * <p>If the mapped keys contains duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}),
     * the value mapping function is applied to each equal element, and the
     * results are merged using the provided merging function.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * There are multiple ways to deal with collisions between multiple elements
     * mapping to the same key.  The other forms of {@code toConcurrentMap} simply use
     * a merge function that throws unconditionally, but you can easily write
     * more flexible merge policies.  For example, if you have a stream
     * of {@code Person}, and you want to produce a "phone book" mapping name to
     * address, but it is possible that two persons have the same name, you can
     * do as follows to gracefully deals with these collisions, and produce a
     * {@code Map} mapping names to a concatenated list of addresses:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Map<String, String> phoneBook
     *         people.stream().collect(toConcurrentMap(Person::getName,
     *                                                 Person::getAddress,
     *                                                 (s, a) -> s + ", " + a));
     * }</pre>

     * <p>This is a {@link Collector.Characteristics#CONCURRENT concurrent} and
