     * Returns the floating-point value adjacent to {@code f} in
     * the direction of negative infinity.  This method is
     * semantically equivalent to {@code nextAfter(f,
     * Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)}; however, a
     * {@code nextDown} implementation may run faster than its
     * equivalent {@code nextAfter} call.
     *
     * <p>Special Cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li> If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
     *
     * <li> If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
     * negative infinity.
     *
     * <li> If the argument is zero, the result is
     * {@code -Float.MIN_VALUE}
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param f  starting floating-point value
     * @return The adjacent floating-point value closer to negative
     * infinity.
