     * Returns a {@link Collection} view of the values contained in this map.
     *
     * <p>The collection's iterator returns the values in ascending order
     * of the corresponding keys. The collection's spliterator is
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>,
     * <em>fail-fast</em>, and additionally reports {@link Spliterator#ORDERED}
     * with an encounter order that is ascending order of the corresponding
     * keys.
     *
     * <p>The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
     * reflected in the collection, and vice-versa.  If the map is
     * modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress
     * (except through the iterator's own {@code remove} operation),
     * the results of the iteration are undefined.  The collection
     * supports element removal, which removes the corresponding
     * mapping from the map, via the {@code Iterator.remove},
     * {@code Collection.remove}, {@code removeAll},
     * {@code retainAll} and {@code clear} operations.  It does not
     * support the {@code add} or {@code addAll} operations.
