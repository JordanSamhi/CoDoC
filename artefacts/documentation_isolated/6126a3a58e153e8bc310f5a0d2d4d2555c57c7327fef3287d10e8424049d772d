     * Best effort method, meaning we may not be able to return
     * the FQDN depending on the underlying system configuration.
     *
     * <p>If there is a security manager, this method first
     * calls its {@code checkConnect} method
     * with the hostname and {@code -1}
     * as its arguments to see if the calling code is allowed to know
     * the hostname for this IP address, i.e., to connect to the host.
     * If the operation is not allowed, it will return
     * the textual representation of the IP address.
     *
     * @return  the fully qualified domain name for this IP address,
     *    or if the operation is not allowed by the security check,
     *    the textual representation of the IP address.
