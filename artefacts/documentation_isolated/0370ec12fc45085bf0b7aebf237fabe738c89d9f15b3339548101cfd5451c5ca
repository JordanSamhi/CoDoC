     * Returns the given number of seed bytes, computed using the seed
     * generation algorithm that this class uses to seed itself.  This
     * call may be used to seed other random number generators.
     *
     * <p>This method is only included for backwards compatibility.
     * The caller is encouraged to use one of the alternative
     * {@code getInstance} methods to obtain a SecureRandom object, and
     * then call the {@code generateSeed} method to obtain seed bytes
     * from that object.
     *
     * @param numBytes the number of seed bytes to generate.
     *
     * @return the seed bytes.
