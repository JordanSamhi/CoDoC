     * <p>If this property is {@code true}, then any error output
     * generated by subprocesses subsequently started by this object's
     * {@link #start()} method will be merged with the standard
     * output, so that both can be read using the
     * {@link Process#getInputStream()} method.  This makes it easier
     * to correlate error messages with the corresponding output.
     * The initial value is {@code false}.
