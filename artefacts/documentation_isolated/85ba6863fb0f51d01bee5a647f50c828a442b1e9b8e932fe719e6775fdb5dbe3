     * Checks if the instant of this {@code OffsetTime} is after that of the
     * specified time applying both times to a common date.
     * <p>
     * This method differs from the comparison in {@link #compareTo} in that it
     * only compares the instant of the time. This is equivalent to converting both
     * times to an instant using the same date and comparing the instants.
     *
     * @param other  the other time to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this is after the instant of the specified time
