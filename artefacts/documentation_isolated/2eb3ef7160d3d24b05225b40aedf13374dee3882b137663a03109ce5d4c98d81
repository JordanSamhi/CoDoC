     * Returns an empty list (immutable).  This list is serializable.
     *
     * <p>This example illustrates the type-safe way to obtain an empty list:
     * <pre>
     *     List&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.emptyList();
     * </pre>
     *
     * @implNote
     * Implementations of this method need not create a separate <tt>List</tt>
     * object for each call.   Using this method is likely to have comparable
     * cost to using the like-named field.  (Unlike this method, the field does
     * not provide type safety.)
     *
     * @param <T> type of elements, if there were any, in the list
     * @return an empty immutable list
