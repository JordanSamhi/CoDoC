     * Constructs a new file system that is identified by a {@link URI}
     *
     * <p> This method first attempts to locate an installed provider in exactly
     * the same manner as the {@link #newFileSystem(URI,Map) newFileSystem(URI,Map)}
     * method. If none of the installed providers support the URI scheme then an
     * attempt is made to locate the provider using the given class loader. If a
     * provider supporting the URI scheme is located then its {@link
     * FileSystemProvider#newFileSystem(URI,Map) newFileSystem(URI,Map)} is
     * invoked to construct the new file system.
     *
     * @param   uri
     *          the URI identifying the file system
     * @param   env
     *          a map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
     *          may be empty
     * @param   loader
     *          the class loader to locate the provider or {@code null} to only
     *          attempt to locate an installed provider
     *
     * @return  a new file system
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the pre-conditions for the {@code uri} parameter are not met,
     *          or the {@code env} parameter does not contain properties required
     *          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
     * @throws  FileSystemAlreadyExistsException
     *          if the URI scheme identifies an installed provider and the file
     *          system has already been created
     * @throws  ProviderNotFoundException
     *          if a provider supporting the URI scheme is not found
     * @throws  ServiceConfigurationError
     *          when an error occurs while loading a service provider
     * @throws  IOException
     *          an I/O error occurs creating the file system
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission required by the file system provider implementation
