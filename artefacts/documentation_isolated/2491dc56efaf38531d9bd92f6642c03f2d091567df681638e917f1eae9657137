     * Cumulates, in parallel, each element of the given array in place,
     * using the supplied function. For example if the array initially
     * holds {@code [2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0]} and the operation performs addition,
     * then upon return the array holds {@code [2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 6.0]}.
     * Parallel prefix computation is usually more efficient than
     * sequential loops for large arrays.
     *
     * <p> Because floating-point operations may not be strictly associative,
     * the returned result may not be identical to the value that would be
     * obtained if the operation was performed sequentially.
     *
     * @param array the array, which is modified in-place by this method
     * @param op a side-effect-free function to perform the cumulation
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified array or function is null
     * @since 1.8
