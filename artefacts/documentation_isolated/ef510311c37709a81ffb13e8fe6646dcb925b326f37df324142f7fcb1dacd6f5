     * The order of formats in the returned array corresponds to

     * Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
     * changes during localization, it's generally better to use the
     * {@link #getFormatsByArgumentIndex getFormatsByArgumentIndex}
     * method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the
     * order of elements in the <code>arguments</code> array passed to
     * the <code>format</code> methods or the result array returned by
     * the <code>parse</code> methods.
