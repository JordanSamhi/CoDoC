     * Opens or creates a file for reading and/or writing, returning an
     * asynchronous file channel to access the file.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
     * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link StandardOpenOption#WRITE
     * WRITE} options determines if the file should be opened for reading and/or
     * writing. If neither option is contained in the array then an existing file
     * is opened for  reading.
     *
     * <p> In addition to {@code READ} and {@code WRITE}, the following options
     * may be present:

     * <p> An implementation may also support additional options.

     * <p> The {@code executor} parameter is the {@link ExecutorService} to
     * which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch completion
     * results for operations initiated on resulting channel.
     * The nature of these tasks is highly implementation specific and so care
     * should be taken when configuring the {@code Executor}. Minimally it
     * should support an unbounded work queue and should not run tasks on the
     * caller thread of the {@link ExecutorService#execute execute} method.
     * Shutting down the executor service while the channel is open results in
     * unspecified behavior.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is an optional array of file {@link
     * FileAttribute file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the file.
     *
     * <p> The new channel is created by invoking the {@link
     * FileSystemProvider#newFileChannel newFileChannel} method on the
