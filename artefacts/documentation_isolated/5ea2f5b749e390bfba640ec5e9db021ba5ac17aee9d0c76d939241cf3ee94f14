     * Creates a URI by parsing the given string.
     *
     * <p> This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the {@link
     * #URI(String)} constructor; any {@link URISyntaxException} thrown by the
     * constructor is caught and wrapped in a new {@link
     * IllegalArgumentException} object, which is then thrown.
     *
     * <p> This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
     * the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
     * within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
     * for the string not to parse as such.  The constructors, which throw
     * {@link URISyntaxException} directly, should be used situations where a
     * URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
     * may be prone to errors.  </p>
     *
     * @param  str   The string to be parsed into a URI
     * @return The new URI
     *
     * @throws  NullPointerException
     *          If {@code str} is {@code null}
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          If the given string violates RFC&nbsp;2396
