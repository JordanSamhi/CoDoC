     * Tests whether a file is executable. This method checks that a file exists
     * and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to {@link
     * Runtime#exec execute} the file. The semantics may differ when checking
     * access to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for
     * execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to
     * search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories.
     *
     * <p> Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file
     * permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to
     * check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not
     * be atomic with respect to other file system operations.
     *
     * <p> Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is
     * no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to execute the file will succeed
     * (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken when
     * using this method in security sensitive applications.

     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to check
     *
     * @return  {@code true} if the file exists and is executable; {@code false}
     *          if the file does not exist, execute access would be denied because
     *          the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
     *          cannot be determined
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkExec(String)
     *          checkExec} is invoked to check execute access to the file.
