     * Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this
     * list at the specified position (optional operation).  Shifts the
     * element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent
     * elements to the right (increases their indices).  The new elements
     * will appear in this list in the order that they are returned by the
     * specified collection's iterator.  The behavior of this operation is
     * undefined if the specified collection is modified while the
     * operation is in progress.  (Note that this will occur if the specified
     * collection is this list, and it's nonempty.)
     *
     * <p>This implementation gets an iterator over the specified collection and
     * a list iterator over this list pointing to the indexed element (with
     * <tt>listIterator(index)</tt>).  Then, it iterates over the specified
     * collection, inserting the elements obtained from the iterator into this
     * list, one at a time, using <tt>ListIterator.add</tt> followed by
     * <tt>ListIterator.next</tt> (to skip over the added element).
     *
     * <p>Note that this implementation will throw an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the list iterator returned by
     * the <tt>listIterator</tt> method does not implement the <tt>add</tt>
     * operation.
