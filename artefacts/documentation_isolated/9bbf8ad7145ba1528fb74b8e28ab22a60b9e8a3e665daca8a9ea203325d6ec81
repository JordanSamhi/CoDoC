     * Obtains an instance of {@code ChronoLocalDate} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a local date based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code ChronoLocalDate}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion extracts and combines the chronology and the date
     * from the temporal object. The behavior is equivalent to using
     * {@link Chronology#date(TemporalAccessor)} with the extracted chronology.
     * Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
     * those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code ChronoLocalDate::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the date, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code ChronoLocalDate}
     * @see Chronology#date(TemporalAccessor)
