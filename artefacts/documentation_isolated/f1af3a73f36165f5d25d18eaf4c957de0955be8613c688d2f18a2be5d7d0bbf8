     * Reads up to <code>len</code> bytes of data from this input stream
     * into an array of bytes.  If <code>len</code> is not zero, the method
     * blocks until at least 1 byte of input is available; otherwise, no
     * bytes are read and <code>0</code> is returned.
     * <p>
     * The <code>read</code> method of <code>SequenceInputStream</code>
     * tries to read the data from the current substream. If it fails to
     * read any characters because the substream has reached the end of
     * the stream, it calls the <code>close</code> method of the current
     * substream and begins reading from the next substream.
     *
     * @param      b     the buffer into which the data is read.
     * @param      off   the start offset in array <code>b</code>
     *                   at which the data is written.
     * @param      len   the maximum number of bytes read.
     * @return     int   the number of bytes read.
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
     * <code>b.length - off</code>
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
