     * Sets the transparency of region bounds for this matcher.
     *
     * <p> Invoking this method with an argument of <tt>true</tt> will set this
     * matcher to use <i>transparent</i> bounds. If the boolean
     * argument is <tt>false</tt>, then <i>opaque</i> bounds will be used.
     *
     * <p> Using transparent bounds, the boundaries of this
     * matcher's region are transparent to lookahead, lookbehind,
     * and boundary matching constructs. Those constructs can see beyond the
     * boundaries of the region to see if a match is appropriate.
     *
     * <p> Using opaque bounds, the boundaries of this matcher's
     * region are opaque to lookahead, lookbehind, and boundary matching
     * constructs that may try to see beyond them. Those constructs cannot
     * look past the boundaries so they will fail to match anything outside
     * of the region.
     *
     * <p> By default, a matcher uses opaque bounds.
     *
     * @param  b a boolean indicating whether to use opaque or transparent
