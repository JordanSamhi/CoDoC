     * Returns true if and only if the specified class was dynamically
     * generated to be a proxy class using the {@code getProxyClass}
     * method or the {@code newProxyInstance} method.
     *
     * <p>The reliability of this method is important for the ability
     * to use it to make security decisions, so its implementation should
     * not just test if the class in question extends {@code Proxy}.
     *
     * @param   cl the class to test
     * @return  {@code true} if the class is a proxy class and
     *          {@code false} otherwise
     * @throws  NullPointerException if {@code cl} is {@code null}
