     * Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the given
     * prefix and suffix strings to generate its name. The resulting
     * {@code Path} is associated with the same {@code FileSystem} as the given
     * directory.
     *
     * <p> The details as to how the name of the file is constructed is
     * implementation dependent and therefore not specified. Where possible
     * the {@code prefix} and {@code suffix} are used to construct candidate
     * names in the same manner as the {@link
     * java.io.File#createTempFile(String,String,File)} method.
     *
     * <p> As with the {@code File.createTempFile} methods, this method is only
     * part of a temporary-file facility. Where used as a <em>work files</em>,
     * the resulting file may be opened using the {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#DELETE_ON_CLOSE DELETE_ON_CLOSE} option so that the
     * file is deleted when the appropriate {@code close} method is invoked.
     * Alternatively, a {@link Runtime#addShutdownHook shutdown-hook}, or the
     * {@link java.io.File#deleteOnExit} mechanism may be used to delete the
     * file automatically.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is optional {@link FileAttribute
     * file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the file. Each attribute
     * is identified by its {@link FileAttribute#name name}. If more than one
     * attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but the last
     * occurrence is ignored. When no file attributes are specified, then the
     * resulting file may have more restrictive access permissions to files
     * created by the {@link java.io.File#createTempFile(String,String,File)}
     * method.
     *
     * @param   dir
     *          the path to directory in which to create the file
     * @param   prefix
     *          the prefix string to be used in generating the file's name;
     *          may be {@code null}
     * @param   suffix
     *          the suffix string to be used in generating the file's name;
     *          may be {@code null}, in which case "{@code .tmp}" is used
     * @param   attrs
     *          an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
     *          creating the file
     *
     * @return  the path to the newly created file that did not exist before
     *          this method was invoked
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the prefix or suffix parameters cannot be used to generate
     *          a candidate file name
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
     *          when creating the directory
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs or {@code dir} does not exist
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
