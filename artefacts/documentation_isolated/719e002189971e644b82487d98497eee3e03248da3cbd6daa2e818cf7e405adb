         * Displays the name of the class from which lookups are to be made.
         * (The name is the one reported by {@link java.lang.Class#getName() Class.getName}.)
         * If there are restrictions on the access permitted to this lookup,
         * this is indicated by adding a suffix to the class name, consisting
         * of a slash and a keyword.  The keyword represents the strongest
         * allowed access, and is chosen as follows:
         * <ul>
         * <li>If no access is allowed, the suffix is "/noaccess".
         * <li>If only public access is allowed, the suffix is "/public".
         * <li>If only public and package access are allowed, the suffix is "/package".
         * <li>If only public, package, and private access are allowed, the suffix is "/private".
         * </ul>
         * If none of the above cases apply, it is the case that full
         * access (public, package, private, and protected) is allowed.
         * In this case, no suffix is added.
         * This is true only of an object obtained originally from
         * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#lookup MethodHandles.lookup}.
         * Objects created by {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in Lookup.in}
         * always have restricted access, and will display a suffix.
         * <p>
         * (It may seem strange that protected access should be
         * stronger than private access.  Viewed independently from
         * package access, protected access is the first to be lost,
         * because it requires a direct subclass relationship between
         * caller and callee.)
