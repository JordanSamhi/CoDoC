     * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
     * with this duration subtracted.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
     * {@link Temporal#minus(TemporalAmount)}.
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
     *   dateTime = thisDuration.subtractFrom(dateTime);
     *   dateTime = dateTime.minus(thisDuration);

     * <p>
     * The calculation will subtract the seconds, then nanos.
     * Only non-zero amounts will be added.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
