     * Obtains an instance of {@code WeekFields} from the first day-of-week and minimal days.
     * <p>
     * The first day-of-week defines the ISO {@code DayOfWeek} that is day 1 of the week.
     * The minimal number of days in the first week defines how many days must be present
     * in a month or year, starting from the first day-of-week, before the week is counted
     * as the first week. A value of 1 will count the first day of the month or year as part
     * of the first week, whereas a value of 7 will require the whole seven days to be in
     * the new month or year.
     * <p>
     * WeekFields instances are singletons; for each unique combination
     * of {@code firstDayOfWeek} and {@code minimalDaysInFirstWeek} the
     * the same instance will be returned.
     *
     * @param firstDayOfWeek  the first day of the week, not null
     * @param minimalDaysInFirstWeek  the minimal number of days in the first week, from 1 to 7
     * @return the week-definition, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the minimal days value is less than one
     *      or greater than 7
