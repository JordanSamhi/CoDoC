     * Returns a lexicographic-order comparator with another comparator.
     * If this {@code Comparator} considers two elements equal, i.e.
     * {@code compare(a, b) == 0}, {@code other} is used to determine the order.
     *
     * <p>The returned comparator is serializable if the specified comparator
     * is also serializable.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * For example, to sort a collection of {@code String} based on the length
     * and then case-insensitive natural ordering, the comparator can be
     * composed using following code,
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Comparator<String> cmp = Comparator.comparingInt(String::length)
     *             .thenComparing(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param  other the other comparator to be used when this comparator
     *         compares two objects that are equal.
     * @return a lexicographic-order comparator composed of this and then the
     *         other comparator
     * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null.
