     * Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down to
     * zero, unless the thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted},
     * or the specified waiting time elapses.
     *
     * <p>If the current count is zero then this method returns immediately
     * with the value {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>If the current count is greater than zero then the current
     * thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
     * dormant until one of three things happen:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The count reaches zero due to invocations of the
     * {@link #countDown} method; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the count reaches zero then the method returns with the
     * value {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then the value {@code false}
     * is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
     * will not wait at all.
     *
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code timeout} argument
     * @return {@code true} if the count reached zero and {@code false}
     *         if the waiting time elapsed before the count reached zero
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     *         while waiting
