     * Obtains an instance of {@code GregorianCalendar} with the default locale
     * from a {@code ZonedDateTime} object.
     * <p>
     * Since {@code ZonedDateTime} does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
     * date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
     * Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
     * which has {@code MONDAY} as the {@link Calendar#getFirstDayOfWeek()
     * FirstDayOfWeek} and {@code 4} as the value of the
     * {@link Calendar#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() MinimalDaysInFirstWeek}.
     * <p>
     * {@code ZoneDateTime} can store points on the time-line further in the
     * future and further in the past than {@code GregorianCalendar}. In this
     * scenario, this method will throw an {@code IllegalArgumentException}
     * exception.
     *
     * @param zdt  the zoned date-time object to convert

     * @exception NullPointerException if {@code zdt} is null
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the zoned date-time is too
     * large to represent as a {@code GregorianCalendar}
