     * Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the specified value for this
     * {@code DatagramSocket}. The SO_RCVBUF option is used by the
     * the network implementation as a hint to size the underlying
     * network I/O buffers. The SO_RCVBUF setting may also be used
     * by the network implementation to determine the maximum size
     * of the packet that can be received on this socket.
     * <p>
     * Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint, applications that want to
     * verify what size the buffers were set to should call
     * {@link #getReceiveBufferSize()}.
     * <p>
     * Increasing SO_RCVBUF may allow the network implementation
     * to buffer multiple packets when packets arrive faster than
     * are being received using {@link #receive(DatagramPacket)}.
     * <p>
     * Note: It is implementation specific if a packet larger
     * than SO_RCVBUF can be received.
     *
     * @param size the size to which to set the receive buffer
     * size. This value must be greater than 0.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error in
     * the underlying protocol, such as an UDP error.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the value is 0 or is
     * negative.
