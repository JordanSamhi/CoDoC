     * Returns true if this pool allows core threads to time out and
     * terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAlive time, being
     * replaced if needed when new tasks arrive. When true, the same
     * keep-alive policy applying to non-core threads applies also to
     * core threads. When false (the default), core threads are never
     * terminated due to lack of incoming tasks.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if core threads are allowed to time out,
     *         else {@code false}
