     * Writes a string to the file using
     * <a href="DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
     * encoding in a machine-independent manner.
     * <p>
     * First, two bytes are written to the file, starting at the
     * current file pointer, as if by the
     * {@code writeShort} method giving the number of bytes to
     * follow. This value is the number of bytes actually written out,
     * not the length of the string. Following the length, each character
     * of the string is output, in sequence, using the modified UTF-8 encoding
     * for each character.
     *
     * @param      str   a string to be written.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
