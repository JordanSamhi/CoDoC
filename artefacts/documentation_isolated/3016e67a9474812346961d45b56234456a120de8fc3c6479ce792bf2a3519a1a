     * Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given
     * predicate.  Errors or runtime exceptions thrown during iteration or by
     * the predicate are relayed to the caller.

     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation traverses all elements of the collection using
     * its {@link #iterator}.  Each matching element is removed using
     * {@link Iterator#remove()}.  If the collection's iterator does not
     * support removal then an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} will be
     * thrown on the first matching element.
     *
     * @param filter a predicate which returns {@code true} for elements to be
     *        removed
     * @return {@code true} if any elements were removed
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified filter is null
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if elements cannot be removed
     *         from this collection.  Implementations may throw this exception if a
     *         matching element cannot be removed or if, in general, removal is not
     *         supported.
