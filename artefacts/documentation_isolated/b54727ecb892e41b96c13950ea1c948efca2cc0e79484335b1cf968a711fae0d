     * Enable or disable layout and scroll.  After <code>setLayoutFrozen(true)</code> is called,
     * Layout requests will be postponed until <code>setLayoutFrozen(false)</code> is called;
     * child views are not updated when RecyclerView is frozen, {@link #smoothScrollBy(int, int)},
     * {@link #scrollBy(int, int)}, {@link #scrollToPosition(int)} and
     * {@link #smoothScrollToPosition(int)} are dropped; TouchEvents and GenericMotionEvents are
     * dropped; {@link LayoutManager#onFocusSearchFailed(View, int, Recycler, State)} will not be
     * called.
     *
     * <p>
     * <code>setLayoutFrozen(true)</code> does not prevent app from directly calling {@link
     * LayoutManager#scrollToPosition(int)}, {@link LayoutManager#smoothScrollToPosition(
     * RecyclerView, State, int)}.
     * <p>
     * {@link #setAdapter(Adapter)} and {@link #swapAdapter(Adapter, boolean)} will automatically
     * stop frozen.
     * <p>
     * Note: Running ItemAnimator is not stopped automatically,  it's caller's
     * responsibility to call ItemAnimator.end().
     *
     * @param frozen   true to freeze layout and scroll, false to re-enable.
