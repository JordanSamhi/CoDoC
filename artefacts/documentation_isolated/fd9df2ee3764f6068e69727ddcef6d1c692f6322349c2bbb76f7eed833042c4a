     * <p>
     * This set includes the string form of all available region-based IDs.
     * Offset-based zone IDs are not included in the returned set.
     * The ID can be passed to {@link #of(String)} to create a {@code ZoneId}.
     * <p>
     * The set of zone IDs can increase over time, although in a typical application
     * the set of IDs is fixed. Each call to this method is thread-safe.
