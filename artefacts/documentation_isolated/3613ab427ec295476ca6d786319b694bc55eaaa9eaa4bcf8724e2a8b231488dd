     * Compares this date-time to another date-time, including the chronology.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is based first on the underlying time-line date-time, then
     * on the chronology.
     * It is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     * <p>
     * For example, the following is the comparator order:
     * <ol>
     * <li>{@code 2012-12-03T12:00 (ISO)}</li>
     * <li>{@code 2012-12-04T12:00 (ISO)}</li>
     * <li>{@code 2555-12-04T12:00 (ThaiBuddhist)}</li>
     * <li>{@code 2012-12-05T12:00 (ISO)}</li>
     * </ol>
     * Values #2 and #3 represent the same date-time on the time-line.
     * When two values represent the same date-time, the chronology ID is compared to distinguish them.
     * This step is needed to make the ordering "consistent with equals".
     * <p>
     * If all the date-time objects being compared are in the same chronology, then the
     * additional chronology stage is not required and only the local date-time is used.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation performs the comparison defined above.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
