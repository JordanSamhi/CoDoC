     * Returns the floating-point number adjacent to the first
     * argument in the direction of the second argument.  If both
     * arguments compare as equal a value equivalent to the second argument
     * is returned.
     *
     * <p>Special cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li> If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned.
     *
     * <li> If both arguments are signed zeros, a value equivalent
     * to {@code direction} is returned.
     *
     * <li> If {@code start} is
     * &plusmn;{@link Float#MIN_VALUE} and {@code direction}
     * has a value such that the result should have a smaller
     * magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as {@code start}
     * is returned.
     *
     * <li> If {@code start} is infinite and
     * {@code direction} has a value such that the result should
     * have a smaller magnitude, {@link Float#MAX_VALUE} with the
     * same sign as {@code start} is returned.
     *
     * <li> If {@code start} is equal to &plusmn;
     * {@link Float#MAX_VALUE} and {@code direction} has a
     * value such that the result should have a larger magnitude, an
     * infinity with same sign as {@code start} is returned.
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param start  starting floating-point value
     * @param direction value indicating which of
     * {@code start}'s neighbors or {@code start} should
     * be returned
     * @return The floating-point number adjacent to {@code start} in the
     * direction of {@code direction}.
