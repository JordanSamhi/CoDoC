     * Creates a localized version of an output stream. This method
     * takes an <code>OutputStream</code> and returns an
     * <code>OutputStream</code> equivalent to the argument in all respects
     * except that it is localized: as Unicode characters are written to
     * the stream, they are automatically converted to the local
     * character set.
     * <p>
     * If the argument is already a localized stream, it may be returned
     * as the result.
     *
     * @deprecated As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to translate a
     * Unicode character stream into a byte stream in the local encoding is via
     * the <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>, <code>BufferedWriter</code>, and
     * <code>PrintWriter</code> classes.
     *
     * @param      out OutputStream to localize
     * @return     a localized output stream
