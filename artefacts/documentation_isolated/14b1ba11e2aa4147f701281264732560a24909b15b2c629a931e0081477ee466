     * Returns a string describing this {@code Constructor},
     * including type parameters.  The string is formatted as the
     * constructor access modifiers, if any, followed by an
     * angle-bracketed comma separated list of the constructor's type
     * parameters, if any, followed by the fully-qualified name of the
     * declaring class, followed by a parenthesized, comma-separated
     * list of the constructor's generic formal parameter types.
     *
     * If this constructor was declared to take a variable number of
     * arguments, instead of denoting the last parameter as
     * "<tt><i>Type</i>[]</tt>", it is denoted as
     * "<tt><i>Type</i>...</tt>".
     *
     * A space is used to separate access modifiers from one another
     * and from the type parameters or return type.  If there are no
     * type parameters, the type parameter list is elided; if the type
     * parameter list is present, a space separates the list from the
     * class name.  If the constructor is declared to throw
     * exceptions, the parameter list is followed by a space, followed
     * by the word "{@code throws}" followed by a
     * comma-separated list of the thrown exception types.
     *
     * <p>The only possible modifiers for constructors are the access
     * modifiers {@code public}, {@code protected} or
     * {@code private}.  Only one of these may appear, or none if the
     * constructor has default (package) access.
