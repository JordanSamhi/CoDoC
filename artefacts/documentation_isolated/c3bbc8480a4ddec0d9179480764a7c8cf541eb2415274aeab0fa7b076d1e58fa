     * Convenience method to animate to a new scene defined by all changes within
     * the given scene root between calling this method and the next rendering frame.
     * Calling this method causes TransitionManager to capture current values in the
     * scene root and then post a request to run a transition on the next frame.
     * At that time, the new values in the scene root will be captured and changes
     * will be animated. There is no need to create a Scene; it is implied by
     * changes which take place between calling this method and the next frame when
     * the transition begins.
     *
     * <p>Calling this method several times before the next frame (for example, if
     * unrelated code also wants to make dynamic changes and run a transition on
     * the same scene root), only the first call will trigger capturing values
     * and exiting the current scene. Subsequent calls to the method with the
     * same scene root during the same frame will be ignored.</p>
     *
     * <p>Passing in <code>null</code> for the transition parameter will
     * cause the TransitionManager to use its default transition.</p>
     *
     * @param sceneRoot The root of the View hierarchy to run the transition on.
     * @param transition The transition to use for this change. A
     * value of null causes the TransitionManager to use the default transition.
