     * Compresses the input data and fills the specified buffer with compressed
     * data. Returns actual number of bytes of data compressed.
     *
     * <p>Compression flush mode is one of the following three modes:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #NO_FLUSH}: allows the deflater to decide how much data
     * to accumulate, before producing output, in order to achieve the best
     * compression (should be used in normal use scenario). A return value
     * of 0 in this flush mode indicates that {@link #needsInput()} should
     * be called in order to determine if more input data is required.
     *
     * <li>{@link #SYNC_FLUSH}: all pending output in the deflater is flushed,
     * to the specified output buffer, so that an inflater that works on
     * compressed data can get all input data available so far (In particular
     * the {@link #needsInput()} returns {@code true} after this invocation
     * if enough output space is provided). Flushing with {@link #SYNC_FLUSH}
     * may degrade compression for some compression algorithms and so it
     * should be used only when necessary.
     *
     * <li>{@link #FULL_FLUSH}: all pending output is flushed out as with
     * {@link #SYNC_FLUSH}. The compression state is reset so that the inflater
     * that works on the compressed output data can restart from this point
     * if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access is
     * desired. Using {@link #FULL_FLUSH} too often can seriously degrade
     * compression.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>In the case of {@link #FULL_FLUSH} or {@link #SYNC_FLUSH}, if
     * the return value is {@code len}, the space available in output
     * buffer {@code b}, this method should be invoked again with the same
     * {@code flush} parameter and more output space.
     *
     * @param b the buffer for the compressed data
     * @param off the start offset of the data
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes of compressed data
     * @param flush the compression flush mode
     * @return the actual number of bytes of compressed data written to
     *         the output buffer
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the flush mode is invalid
     * @since 1.7
