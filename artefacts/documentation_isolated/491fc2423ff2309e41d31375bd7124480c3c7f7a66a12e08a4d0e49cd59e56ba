     * Specifies that numbers should be parsed by this tokenizer. The
     * syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve
     * characters:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . -
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * <p>
     * has the "numeric" attribute.
     * <p>
     * When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
     * double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
     * number rather than a word, by setting the {@code ttype}
     * field to the value {@code TT_NUMBER} and putting the numeric
     * value of the token into the {@code nval} field.
