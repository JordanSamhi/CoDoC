     * The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file

     * {@code readUnsignedShort}. This value gives the number of
     * following bytes that are in the encoded string, not
     * the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then
     * interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format
     * and are converted into characters.
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
