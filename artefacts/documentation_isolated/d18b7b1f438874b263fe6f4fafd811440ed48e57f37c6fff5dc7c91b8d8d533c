     * Creates an asynchronous channel group with a fixed thread pool.
     *
     * <p> The resulting asynchronous channel group reuses a fixed number of
     * threads. At any point, at most {@code nThreads} threads will be active
     * processing tasks that are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch
     * completion results for operations initiated on asynchronous channels in
     * the group.
     *
     * <p> The group is created by invoking the {@link
     * AsynchronousChannelProvider#openAsynchronousChannelGroup(int,ThreadFactory)
     * openAsynchronousChannelGroup(int,ThreadFactory)} method of the system-wide
     * default {@link AsynchronousChannelProvider} object.
     *
     * @param   nThreads
     *          The number of threads in the pool
     * @param   threadFactory
     *          The factory to use when creating new threads
     *
     * @return  A new asynchronous channel group
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          If {@code nThreads <= 0}
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If an I/O error occurs
