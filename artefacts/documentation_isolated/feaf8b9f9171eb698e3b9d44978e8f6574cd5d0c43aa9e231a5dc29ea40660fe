     * Enable/disable {@link SocketOptions#SO_OOBINLINE SO_OOBINLINE}
     * (receipt of TCP urgent data)
     *
     * By default, this option is disabled and TCP urgent data received on a
     * socket is silently discarded. If the user wishes to receive urgent data, then
     * this option must be enabled. When enabled, urgent data is received
     * inline with normal data.
     * <p>
     * Note, only limited support is provided for handling incoming urgent
     * data. In particular, no notification of incoming urgent data is provided
     * and there is no capability to distinguish between normal data and urgent
     * data unless provided by a higher level protocol.
     *
     * @param on {@code true} to enable

     *           {@code false} to disable.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error
     * in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
