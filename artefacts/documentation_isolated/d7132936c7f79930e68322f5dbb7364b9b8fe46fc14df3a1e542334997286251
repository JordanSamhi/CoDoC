     * Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock with the
     * specified duration added
     * <p>
     * This clock wraps another clock, returning instants that are later by the
     * specified duration. If the duration is negative, the instants will be
     * earlier than the current date and time.
     * The main use case for this is to simulate running in the future or in the past.
     * <p>
     * A duration of zero would have no offsetting effect.
     * Passing zero will return the underlying clock.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}
     * providing that the base clock is.
     *
     * @param baseClock  the base clock to add the duration to, not null
     * @param offsetDuration  the duration to add, not null
     * @return a clock based on the base clock with the duration added, not null
