     * The input 2011-01-15 will return 2011-02-01.<br>
     * The input 2011-02-15 will return 2011-03-01.
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It is equivalent to:
     * <pre>
     *  temporal.with(DAY_OF_MONTH, 1).plus(1, MONTHS);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @return the first day of next month adjuster, not null
