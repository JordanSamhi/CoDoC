     * Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the specified
     * comparator.  If the specified comparator is {@code null}, this method is
     * equivalent to {@link #reverseOrder()} (in other words, it returns a
     * comparator that imposes the reverse of the <em>natural ordering</em> on
     * a collection of objects that implement the Comparable interface).
     *
     * <p>The returned comparator is serializable (assuming the specified
     * comparator is also serializable or {@code null}).
     *
     * @param <T> the class of the objects compared by the comparator
     * @param cmp a comparator who's ordering is to be reversed by the returned
     * comparator or {@code null}
     * @return A comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the
     *         specified comparator.
