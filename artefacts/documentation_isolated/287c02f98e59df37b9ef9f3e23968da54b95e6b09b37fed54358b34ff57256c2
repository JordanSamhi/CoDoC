     * Reset will disregard the state of any objects already written to the
     * stream.  The state is reset to be the same as a new ObjectOutputStream.
     * The current point in the stream is marked as reset so the corresponding
     * ObjectInputStream will be reset at the same point.  Objects previously
     * written to the stream will not be referred to as already being in the
     * stream.  They will be written to the stream again.
     *
     * @throws  IOException if reset() is invoked while serializing an object.
