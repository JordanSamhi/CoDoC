     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZoneId} using its ID using a map
     * of aliases to supplement the standard zone IDs.
     * <p>
     * Many users of time-zones use short abbreviations, such as PST for
     * 'Pacific Standard Time' and PDT for 'Pacific Daylight Time'.
     * These abbreviations are not unique, and so cannot be used as IDs.
     * This method allows a map of string to time-zone to be setup and reused
     * within an application.
     *
     * @param zoneId  the time-zone ID, not null
     * @param aliasMap  a map of alias zone IDs (typically abbreviations) to real zone IDs, not null
     * @return the zone ID, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the zone ID has an invalid format
     * @throws ZoneRulesException if the zone ID is a region ID that cannot be found
