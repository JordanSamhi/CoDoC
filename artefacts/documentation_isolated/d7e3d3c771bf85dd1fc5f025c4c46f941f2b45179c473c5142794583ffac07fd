     * Read all lines from a file. This method ensures that the file is
     * closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime
     * exception, is thrown. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
     * using the specified charset.
     *
     * <p> This method recognizes the following as line terminators:
     * <ul>
     *   <li> <code>&#92;u000D</code> followed by <code>&#92;u000A</code>,
     *     CARRIAGE RETURN followed by LINE FEED </li>
     *   <li> <code>&#92;u000A</code>, LINE FEED </li>
     *   <li> <code>&#92;u000D</code>, CARRIAGE RETURN </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p> Additional Unicode line terminators may be recognized in future
     * releases.
     *
     * <p> Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
     * convenient to read all lines in a single operation. It is not intended
     * for reading in large files.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   cs
     *          the charset to use for decoding
     *
     * @return  the lines from the file as a {@code List}; whether the {@code
     *          List} is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
     *          therefore not specified
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
     *          unmappable byte sequence is read
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
