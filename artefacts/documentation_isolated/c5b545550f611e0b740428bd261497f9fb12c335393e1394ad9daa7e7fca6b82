     * Returns a string map view of this process builder's environment.
     *
     * Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is
     * initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see
     * {@link System#getenv()}).  Subprocesses subsequently started by
     * this object's {@link #start()} method will use this map as
     * their environment.
     *
     * <p>The returned object may be modified using ordinary {@link
     * java.util.Map Map} operations.  These modifications will be
     * visible to subprocesses started via the {@link #start()}
     * method.  Two {@code ProcessBuilder} instances always
     * contain independent process environments, so changes to the
     * returned map will never be reflected in any other
     * {@code ProcessBuilder} instance or the values returned by
     * {@link System#getenv System.getenv}.
     *
     * <p>If the system does not support environment variables, an
     * empty map is returned.
     *
     * <p>The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
     * Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
     * value will throw a {@link NullPointerException}.
     * Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
     * of type {@link String} will throw a {@link ClassCastException}.
     *
     * <p>The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent.  A
     * system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
     * may forbid certain variable names or values.  For this reason,
     * attempts to modify the map may fail with
     * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException}
     * if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.
     *
     * <p>Since the external format of environment variable names and
     * values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
     * mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings.  Nevertheless,
     * the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
     * which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
     * native representation in the subprocess.
     *
     * <p>The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
     * general contract of the {@link Object#equals} and
     * {@link Object#hashCode} methods.
     *
     * <p>The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.
     *
     * <p>If a security manager exists, its
     * {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission} method
     * is called with a
     * {@link RuntimePermission}{@code ("getenv.*")} permission.
     * This may result in a {@link SecurityException} being thrown.
     *
     * <p>When passing information to a Java subprocess,
     * <a href=System.html#EnvironmentVSSystemProperties>system properties</a>
     * are generally preferred over environment variables.
     *
     * @return this process builder's environment

     *         if a security manager exists and its
