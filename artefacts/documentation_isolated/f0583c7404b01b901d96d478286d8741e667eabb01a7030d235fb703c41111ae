     * Makes a <em>variable arity</em> adapter which is able to accept
     * any number of trailing positional arguments and collect them
     * into an array argument.
     * <p>
     * The type and behavior of the adapter will be the same as
     * the type and behavior of the target, except that certain
     * {@code invoke} and {@code asType} requests can lead to
     * trailing positional arguments being collected into target's
     * trailing parameter.
     * Also, the last parameter type of the adapter will be
     * {@code arrayType}, even if the target has a different
     * last parameter type.
     * <p>
     * This transformation may return {@code this} if the method handle is
     * already of variable arity and its trailing parameter type
     * is identical to {@code arrayType}.
     * <p>
     * When called with {@link #invokeExact invokeExact}, the adapter invokes
     * the target with no argument changes.
     * (<em>Note:</em> This behavior is different from a
     * {@linkplain #asCollector fixed arity collector},
     * since it accepts a whole array of indeterminate length,
     * rather than a fixed number of arguments.)
     * <p>
     * When called with plain, inexact {@link #invoke invoke}, if the caller
     * type is the same as the adapter, the adapter invokes the target as with
     * {@code invokeExact}.
     * (This is the normal behavior for {@code invoke} when types match.)
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, if the caller and adapter arity are the same, and the
     * trailing parameter type of the caller is a reference type identical to
     * or assignable to the trailing parameter type of the adapter,
     * the arguments and return values are converted pairwise,
     * as if by {@link #asType asType} on a fixed arity
     * method handle.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, the arities differ, or the adapter's trailing parameter
     * type is not assignable from the corresponding caller type.
     * In this case, the adapter replaces all trailing arguments from
     * the original trailing argument position onward, by
     * a new array of type {@code arrayType}, whose elements
     * comprise (in order) the replaced arguments.
     * <p>
     * The caller type must provides as least enough arguments,
     * and of the correct type, to satisfy the target's requirement for
     * positional arguments before the trailing array argument.
     * Thus, the caller must supply, at a minimum, {@code N-1} arguments,
     * where {@code N} is the arity of the target.
     * Also, there must exist conversions from the incoming arguments
     * to the target's arguments.
     * As with other uses of plain {@code invoke}, if these basic
     * requirements are not fulfilled, a {@code WrongMethodTypeException}
     * may be thrown.
     * <p>
     * In all cases, what the target eventually returns is returned unchanged by the adapter.
     * <p>
     * In the final case, it is exactly as if the target method handle were
     * temporarily adapted with a {@linkplain #asCollector fixed arity collector}
     * to the arity required by the caller type.
     * (As with {@code asCollector}, if the array length is zero,
     * a shared constant may be used instead of a new array.
     * If the implied call to {@code asCollector} would throw
     * an {@code IllegalArgumentException} or {@code WrongMethodTypeException},
     * the call to the variable arity adapter must throw
     * {@code WrongMethodTypeException}.)
     * <p>
     * The behavior of {@link #asType asType} is also specialized for
     * variable arity adapters, to maintain the invariant that
     * plain, inexact {@code invoke} is always equivalent to an {@code asType}
     * call to adjust the target type, followed by {@code invokeExact}.
     * Therefore, a variable arity adapter responds
     * to an {@code asType} request by building a fixed arity collector,
     * if and only if the adapter and requested type differ either
     * in arity or trailing argument type.
     * The resulting fixed arity collector has its type further adjusted
     * (if necessary) to the requested type by pairwise conversion,
     * as if by another application of {@code asType}.
     * <p>
     * When a method handle is obtained by executing an {@code ldc} instruction
     * of a {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle} constant, and the target method is marked
     * as a variable arity method (with the modifier bit {@code 0x0080}),
     * the method handle will accept multiple arities, as if the method handle
     * constant were created by means of a call to {@code asVarargsCollector}.
     * <p>
     * In order to create a collecting adapter which collects a predetermined
     * number of arguments, and whose type reflects this predetermined number,
     * use {@link #asCollector asCollector} instead.
     * <p>
     * No method handle transformations produce new method handles with
     * variable arity, unless they are documented as doing so.
     * Therefore, besides {@code asVarargsCollector},
     * all methods in {@code MethodHandle} and {@code MethodHandles}
     * will return a method handle with fixed arity,
     * except in the cases where they are specified to return their original
     * operand (e.g., {@code asType} of the method handle's own type).
     * <p>
     * Calling {@code asVarargsCollector} on a method handle which is already
     * of variable arity will produce a method handle with the same type and behavior.
     * It may (or may not) return the original variable arity method handle.
     * <p>
     * Here is an example, of a list-making variable arity method handle:
     * <blockquote><pre>{@code
MethodHandle deepToString = publicLookup()
  .findStatic(Arrays.class, "deepToString", methodType(String.class, Object[].class));
MethodHandle ts1 = deepToString.asVarargsCollector(Object[].class);
assertEquals("[won]",   (String) ts1.invokeExact(    new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]",   (String) ts1.invoke(         new Object[]{"won"}));
assertEquals("[won]",   (String) ts1.invoke(                      "won" ));
assertEquals("[[won]]", (String) ts1.invoke((Object) new Object[]{"won"}));
// findStatic of Arrays.asList(...) produces a variable arity method handle:
MethodHandle asList = publicLookup()
  .findStatic(Arrays.class, "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
assertEquals(methodType(List.class, Object[].class), asList.type());
assert(asList.isVarargsCollector());
assertEquals("[]", asList.invoke().toString());
assertEquals("[1]", asList.invoke(1).toString());
assertEquals("[two, too]", asList.invoke("two", "too").toString());
String[] argv = { "three", "thee", "tee" };
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke(argv).toString());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", asList.invoke((Object[])argv).toString());
List ls = (List) asList.invoke((Object)argv);
assertEquals(1, ls.size());
assertEquals("[three, thee, tee]", Arrays.toString((Object[])ls.get(0)));
     * }</pre></blockquote>

     * <em>Discussion:</em>
     * These rules are designed as a dynamically-typed variation
     * of the Java rules for variable arity methods.
     * In both cases, callers to a variable arity method or method handle
     * can either pass zero or more positional arguments, or else pass
     * pre-collected arrays of any length.  Users should be aware of the
     * special role of the final argument, and of the effect of a
     * type match on that final argument, which determines whether
     * or not a single trailing argument is interpreted as a whole
     * array or a single element of an array to be collected.
     * Note that the dynamic type of the trailing argument has no
     * effect on this decision, only a comparison between the symbolic
     * type descriptor of the call site and the type descriptor of the method handle.)
     *
     * @param arrayType often {@code Object[]}, the type of the array argument which will collect the arguments
     * @return a new method handle which can collect any number of trailing arguments
     *         into an array, before calling the original method handle
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code arrayType} is a null reference
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code arrayType} is not an array type
     *         or {@code arrayType} is not assignable to this method handle's trailing parameter type
