     * Register an object to be validated before the graph is returned.  While
     * similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire
     * graph has been reconstituted.  Typically, a readObject method will
     * register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are
     * restored a final set of validations can be performed.
     *
     * @param   obj the object to receive the validation callback.
     * @param   prio controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.
     *          Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for
     *          later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in
     *          no particular order.
     * @throws  NotActiveException The stream is not currently reading objects
     *          so it is invalid to register a callback.
     * @throws  InvalidObjectException The validation object is null.
