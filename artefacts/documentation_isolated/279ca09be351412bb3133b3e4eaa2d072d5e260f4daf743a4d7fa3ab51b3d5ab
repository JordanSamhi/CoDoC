     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified set.
     * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in
     * an immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a set contains
     * no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe
     * view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the set
     * takes place through the view, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the
     * set cannot contain an incorrectly typed element.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
     * checkedCollection} method.
     *
     * <p>The returned set will be serializable if the specified set is
     * serializable.
     *
     * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
     * type, the returned set permits insertion of null elements whenever
     * the backing set does.
     *
     * @param <E> the class of the objects in the set

     *          returned
     * @param type the type of element that {@code s} is permitted to hold
