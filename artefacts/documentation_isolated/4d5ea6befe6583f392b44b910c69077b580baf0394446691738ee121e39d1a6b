     * Gets the name of the property that will be animated. This name will be used to derive
     * a setter function that will be called to set animated values.
     * For example, a property name of <code>foo</code> will result
     * in a call to the function <code>setFoo()</code> on the target object. If either
     * <code>valueFrom</code> or <code>valueTo</code> is null, then a getter function will
     * also be derived and called.
