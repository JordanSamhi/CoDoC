     * Called whenever a key, touch, or trackball event is dispatched to the
     * activity.  Implement this method if you wish to know that the user has
     * interacted with the device in some way while your activity is running.
     * This callback and {@link #onUserLeaveHint} are intended to help
     * activities manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically,
     * for helping activities determine the proper time to cancel a notification.
     *
     * <p>All calls to your activity's {@link #onUserLeaveHint} callback will
     * be accompanied by calls to {@link #onUserInteraction}.  This
     * ensures that your activity will be told of relevant user activity such
     * as pulling down the notification pane and touching an item there.
     *
     * <p>Note that this callback will be invoked for the touch down action
     * that begins a touch gesture, but may not be invoked for the touch-moved
     * and touch-up actions that follow.
