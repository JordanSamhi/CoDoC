     * Obtains a {@code Duration} representing a number of seconds and an
     * adjustment in nanoseconds.
     * <p>
     * This method allows an arbitrary number of nanoseconds to be passed in.
     * The factory will alter the values of the second and nanosecond in order
     * to ensure that the stored nanosecond is in the range 0 to 999,999,999.
     * For example, the following will result in the exactly the same duration:
     * <pre>
     *  Duration.ofSeconds(3, 1);
     *  Duration.ofSeconds(4, -999_999_999);
     *  Duration.ofSeconds(2, 1000_000_001);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param seconds  the number of seconds, positive or negative
     * @param nanoAdjustment  the nanosecond adjustment to the number of seconds, positive or negative
     * @return a {@code Duration}, not null
     * @throws ArithmeticException if the adjustment causes the seconds to exceed the capacity of {@code Duration}
