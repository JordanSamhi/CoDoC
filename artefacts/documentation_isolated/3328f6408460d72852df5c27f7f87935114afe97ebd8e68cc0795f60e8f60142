     * Returns the smaller of two {@code float} values.  That is,
     * the result is the value closer to negative infinity. If the
     * arguments have the same value, the result is that same
     * value. If either value is NaN, then the result is NaN.  Unlike
     * the numerical comparison operators, this method considers
     * negative zero to be strictly smaller than positive zero.  If
     * one argument is positive zero and the other is negative zero,
     * the result is negative zero.
     *
     * @param   a   an argument.
     * @param   b   another argument.
     * @return  the smaller of {@code a} and {@code b}.
