     * Return a lazily populated {@code Stream}, the elements of
     * which are the entries in the directory.  The listing is not recursive.
     *
     * <p> The elements of the stream are {@link Path} objects that are
     * obtained as if by {@link Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the name of the
     * directory entry against {@code dir}. Some file systems maintain special
     * links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
     * Entries representing these links are not included.
     *
     * <p> The stream is <i>weakly consistent</i>. It is thread safe but does
     * not freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not)
     * reflect updates to the directory that occur after returning from this
     * method.
     *
     * <p> The returned stream encapsulates a {@link DirectoryStream}.
     * If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the
     * {@code try}-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
     * stream's {@link Stream#close close} method is invoked after the stream
     * operations are completed.
     *
     * <p> Operating on a closed stream behaves as if the end of stream
     * has been reached. Due to read-ahead, one or more elements may be
     * returned after the stream has been closed.
     *
     * <p> If an {@link IOException} is thrown when accessing the directory
     * after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an {@link
     * UncheckedIOException} which will be thrown from the method that caused
     * the access to take place.
     *
     * @param   dir  The path to the directory

     * @return  The {@code Stream} describing the content of the
     *          directory
     *
     * @throws  NotDirectoryException
     *          if the file could not otherwise be opened because it is not
     *          a directory <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs when opening the directory
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the directory.
