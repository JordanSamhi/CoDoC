     * Returns a {@link Collection} view of the values contained in this map.
     * The returned collection obeys the general contract outlined in
     * {@link Map#values()}.  The collection's iterator will return the
     * values in the order their corresponding keys appear in map,
     * which is their natural order (the order in which the enum constants
     * are declared).
