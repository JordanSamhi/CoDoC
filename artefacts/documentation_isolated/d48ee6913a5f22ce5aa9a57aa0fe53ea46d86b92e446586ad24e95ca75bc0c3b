     * Returns the content of this URI as a string.
     *
     * <p> If this URI was created by invoking one of the constructors in this
     * class then a string equivalent to the original input string, or to the
     * string computed from the originally-given components, as appropriate, is
     * returned.  Otherwise this URI was created by normalization, resolution,
     * or relativization, and so a string is constructed from this URI's
     * components according to the rules specified in <a
     * href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC&nbsp;2396</a>,
     * section&nbsp;5.2, step&nbsp;7. </p>

     * @return  The string form of this URI
