     * Returns the day-of-week in month adjuster, which returns a new date
     * in the same month with the ordinal day-of-week.
     * This is used for expressions like the 'second Tuesday in March'.
     * <p>
     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (2,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-13.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (3,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-20.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (4,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-27.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (5,TUESDAY) will return 2012-01-03.<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (-1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-27 (last in month).<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (-4,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06 (3 weeks before last in month).<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (-5,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (4 weeks before last in month).<br>
     * The input 2011-12-15 for (0,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (last in previous month).<br>
     * <p>
     * For a positive or zero ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the first
     * day-of-week that matches within the month and then adding a number of weeks to it.
     * For a negative ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the last
     * day-of-week that matches within the month and then subtracting a number of weeks to it.
     * The ordinal number of weeks is not validated and is interpreted leniently
     * according to this algorithm. This definition means that an ordinal of zero finds
     * the last matching day-of-week in the previous month.
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} fields
     * and the {@code DAYS} unit, and assumes a seven day week.
     *
     * @param ordinal  the week within the month, unbounded but typically from -5 to 5
     * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week, not null
     * @return the day-of-week in month adjuster, not null
