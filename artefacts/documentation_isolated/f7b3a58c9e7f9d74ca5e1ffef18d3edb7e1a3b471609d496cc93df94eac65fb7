     * Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
     * write bytes to the file. The resulting stream will not be buffered. The
     * stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
     * the returned stream is <i>asynchronously closeable</i> and/or
     * <i>interruptible</i> is highly file system provider specific and
     * therefore not specified.
     *
     * <p> This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
     * by the {@link #newByteChannel(Path,Set,FileAttribute[]) newByteChannel}
     * method with the exception that the {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ}
     * option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
     * present then this method works as if the {@link StandardOpenOption#CREATE
     * CREATE}, {@link StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING},
     * and {@link StandardOpenOption#WRITE WRITE} options are present. In other
     * words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
     * exist, or initially truncating an existing {@link #isRegularFile
     * regular-file} to a size of {@code 0} if it exists.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Examples:</b>
     * <pre>
     *     Path path = ...
     *
     *     // truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
     *     // it doesn't initially exist
     *     OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(path);
     *
     *     // append to an existing file, fail if the file does not exist
     *     out = Files.newOutputStream(path, APPEND);
     *
     *     // append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
     *     out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);
     *
     *     // always create new file, failing if it already exists
     *     out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE_NEW);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new output stream
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if {@code options} contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete} method is
     *          invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the
     *          {@code DELETE_ON_CLOSE} option.
