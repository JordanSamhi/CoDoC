     * Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this month-day.
     * <p>
     * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
     * with the month and day-of-month changed to be the same as this.
     * <p>
     * The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
     * twice, passing {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR} and
     * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH} as the fields.
     * If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
     * a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
     * {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
     *   temporal = thisMonthDay.adjustInto(temporal);
     *   temporal = temporal.with(thisMonthDay);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param temporal  the target object to be adjusted, not null
     * @return the adjusted object, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to make the adjustment
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
