     * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the time truncated.
     * <p>
     * Truncation returns a copy of the original date-time with fields
     * smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
     * For example, truncating with the {@link ChronoUnit#MINUTES minutes} unit
     * will set the second-of-minute and nano-of-second field to zero.
     * <p>
     * The unit must have a {@linkplain TemporalUnit#getDuration() duration}
     * that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
     * This includes all supplied time units on {@link ChronoUnit} and
     * {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS}. Other units throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * This operates on the local time-line,
     * {@link LocalDateTime#truncatedTo(TemporalUnit) truncating}
     * the underlying local date-time. This is then converted back to a
     * {@code ZonedDateTime}, using the zone ID to obtain the offset.
     * <p>
     * When converting back to {@code ZonedDateTime}, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
     * then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
     * If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
