     * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (MONDAY) will return 2011-01-17 (two days later).<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (WEDNESDAY) will return 2011-01-19 (four days later).<br>
     * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (SATURDAY) will return 2011-01-22 (seven days later).
     * <p>
     * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
     * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} field and the {@code DAYS} unit,
     * and assumes a seven day week.
