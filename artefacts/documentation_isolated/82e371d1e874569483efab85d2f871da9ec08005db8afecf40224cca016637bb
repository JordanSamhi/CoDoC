     * it was in when previously initialized for verification via a
     * call to {@code initVerify(PublicKey)}. That is, the object is
     * reset and available to verify another signature from the identity
     * whose public key was specified in the call to {@code initVerify}.

     * @param signature the signature bytes to be verified.
     *
     * @return true if the signature was verified, false if not.

     * @exception SignatureException if this signature object is not
     * initialized properly, the passed-in signature is improperly
     * encoded or of the wrong type, if this signature algorithm is unable to
     * process the input data provided, etc.
