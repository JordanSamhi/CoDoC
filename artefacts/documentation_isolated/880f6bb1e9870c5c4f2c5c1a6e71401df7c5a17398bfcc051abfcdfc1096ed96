     * Checks if the specified field is supported.
     * <p>
     * This checks if the specified field can be queried on this date.
     * If false, then calling the {@link #range(TemporalField) range},
     * {@link #get(TemporalField) get} and {@link #with(TemporalField, long)}
     * methods will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * The set of supported fields is defined by the chronology and normally includes
     * all {@code ChronoField} date fields.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.
     *
     * @param field  the field to check, null returns false
     * @return true if the field can be queried, false if not
