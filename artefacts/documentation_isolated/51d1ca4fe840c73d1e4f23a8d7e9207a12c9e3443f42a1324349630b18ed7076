     * This queries this day-of-week for the value of the specified field.
     * The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
     * If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
     * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} then the
     * value of the day-of-week, from 1 to 7, will be returned.
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
     * and what the value represents, is determined by the field.
