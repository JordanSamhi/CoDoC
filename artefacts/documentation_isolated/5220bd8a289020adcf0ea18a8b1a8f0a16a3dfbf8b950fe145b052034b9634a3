     * Returns a {@code Method} object that reflects the specified
     * declared method of the class or interface represented by this
     * {@code Class} object. The {@code name} parameter is a
     * {@code String} that specifies the simple name of the desired
     * method, and the {@code parameterTypes} parameter is an array of
     * {@code Class} objects that identify the method's formal parameter
     * types, in declared order.  If more than one method with the same
     * parameter types is declared in a class, and one of these methods has a
     * return type that is more specific than any of the others, that method is
     * returned; otherwise one of the methods is chosen arbitrarily.  If the
     * name is "&lt;init&gt;"or "&lt;clinit&gt;" a {@code NoSuchMethodException}
     * is raised.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an array type, then this
     * method does not find the {@code clone()} method.
     *
     * @param name the name of the method
     * @param parameterTypes the parameter array
     * @return  the {@code Method} object for the method of this class
     *          matching the specified name and parameters
     * @throws  NoSuchMethodException if a matching method is not found.
     * @throws  NullPointerException if {@code name} is {@code null}
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager, <i>s</i>, is present and any of the

     *
     *          <ul>
     *
     *          <li> the caller's class loader is not the same as the
     *          class loader of this class and invocation of
     *          {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission

     *          {@code RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers")}
     *          denies access to the declared method
     *
     *          <li> the caller's class loader is not the same as or an
     *          ancestor of the class loader for the current class and
     *          invocation of {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     *          s.checkPackageAccess()} denies access to the package
     *          of this class
