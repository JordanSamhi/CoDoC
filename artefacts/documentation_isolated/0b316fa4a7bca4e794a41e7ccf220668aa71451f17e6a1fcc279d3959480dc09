         * Produces a method handle giving write access to a static field.
         * The type of the method handle will have a void return type.
         * The method handle will take a single
         * argument, of the field's value type, the value to be stored.
         * Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
         * <p>
         * If the returned method handle is invoked, the field's class will
         * be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.
         * @param refc the class or interface from which the method is accessed
         * @param name the field's name
         * @param type the field's type
         * @return a method handle which can store values into the field
         * @throws NoSuchFieldException if the field does not exist
         * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails, or if the field is not {@code static}
         * @exception SecurityException if a security manager is present and it
         *                              <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">refuses access</a>
         * @throws NullPointerException if any argument is null
