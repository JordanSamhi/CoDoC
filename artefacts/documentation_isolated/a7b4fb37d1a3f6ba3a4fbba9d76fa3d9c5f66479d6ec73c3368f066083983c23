     * Returns a copy of this instant with the specified amount subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This returns an {@code Instant}, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
     * The amount is typically {@link Duration} but may be any other type implementing
     * the {@link TemporalAmount} interface.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
     * {@link TemporalAmount#subtractFrom(Temporal)}. The amount implementation is free
     * to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
     * calls back to {@link #minus(long, TemporalUnit)}. Consult the documentation
     * of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param amountToSubtract  the amount to subtract, not null
     * @return an {@code Instant} based on this instant with the subtraction made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the subtraction cannot be made
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
