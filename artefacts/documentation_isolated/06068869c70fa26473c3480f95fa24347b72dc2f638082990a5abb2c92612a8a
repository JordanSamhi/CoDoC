     * Obtains an instance of {@code MonthDay} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a month-day based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code MonthDay}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion extracts the {@link ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR MONTH_OF_YEAR} and
     * {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH DAY_OF_MONTH} fields.
     * The extraction is only permitted if the temporal object has an ISO
     * chronology, or can be converted to a {@code LocalDate}.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code MonthDay::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the month-day, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code MonthDay}
