     * Returns an array of {@code Type} objects that represent the
     * exceptions declared to be thrown by this executable object.
     * Returns an array of length 0 if the underlying executable declares
     * no exceptions in its {@code throws} clause.
     *
     * <p>If an exception type is a type variable or a parameterized
     * type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.

     * @return an array of Types that represent the exception types
     *     thrown by the underlying executable
     * @throws GenericSignatureFormatError
     *     if the generic method signature does not conform to the format
     *     specified in
     *     <cite>The Java&trade; Virtual Machine Specification</cite>
     * @throws TypeNotPresentException if the underlying executable's
     *     {@code throws} clause refers to a non-existent type declaration
     * @throws MalformedParameterizedTypeException if
     *     the underlying executable's {@code throws} clause refers to a
