     * Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent call to
     * the <code>reset</code> method repositions this stream at the last marked
     * position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.
     *
     * <p> The <code>readlimit</code> arguments tells this input stream to
     * allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
     * invalidated.
     *
     * <p> The general contract of <code>mark</code> is that, if the method
     * <code>markSupported</code> returns <code>true</code>, the stream somehow
     * remembers all the bytes read after the call to <code>mark</code> and
     * stands ready to supply those same bytes again if and whenever the method
     * <code>reset</code> is called.  However, the stream is not required to
     * remember any data at all if more than <code>readlimit</code> bytes are
     * read from the stream before <code>reset</code> is called.
     *
     * <p> Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.
     *
     * <p> The <code>mark</code> method of <code>InputStream</code> does
     * nothing.
     *
     * @param   readlimit   the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
     *                      the mark position becomes invalid.
