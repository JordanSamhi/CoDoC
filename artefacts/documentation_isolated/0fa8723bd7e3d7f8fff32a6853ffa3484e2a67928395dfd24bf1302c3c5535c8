     * Convenience method that encodes Unicode characters into bytes in this
     * charset.
     *
     * <p> An invocation of this method upon a charset <tt>cs</tt> returns the
     * same result as the expression
     *
     * <pre>
     *     cs.newEncoder()
     *       .onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
     *       .onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
     *       .encode(bb); </pre>
     *
     * except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
     * encoders between successive invocations.
     *
     * <p> This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
     * sequences with this charset's default replacement string.  In order to
     * detect such sequences, use the {@link
     * CharsetEncoder#encode(java.nio.CharBuffer)} method directly.  </p>
     *
     * @param  cb  The char buffer to be encoded
     *
     * @return  A byte buffer containing the encoded characters
