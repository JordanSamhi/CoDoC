     * Combines this year-month with a day-of-month to create a {@code LocalDate}.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code LocalDate} formed from this year-month and the specified day-of-month.
     * <p>
     * The day-of-month value must be valid for the year-month.
     * <p>
     * This method can be used as part of a chain to produce a date:
     * <pre>
     *  LocalDate date = year.atMonth(month).atDay(day);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param dayOfMonth  the day-of-month to use, from 1 to 31
     * @return the date formed from this year-month and the specified day, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the day is invalid for the year-month
     * @see #isValidDay(int)
