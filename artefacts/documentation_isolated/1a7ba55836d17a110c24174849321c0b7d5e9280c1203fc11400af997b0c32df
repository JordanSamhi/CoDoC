     * Returns a {@code Collector} implementing a cascaded "group by" operation
     * on input elements of type {@code T}, grouping elements according to a
     * classification function, and then performing a reduction operation on
     * the values associated with a given key using the specified downstream
     * {@code Collector}.  The {@code Map} produced by the Collector is created
     * with the supplied factory function.
     *
     * <p>The classification function maps elements to some key type {@code K}.
     * The downstream collector operates on elements of type {@code T} and
     * produces a result of type {@code D}. The resulting collector produces a
     * {@code Map<K, D>}.
     *
     * <p>For example, to compute the set of last names of people in each city,
     * where the city names are sorted:
     * <pre>{@code
     *     Map<City, Set<String>> namesByCity
     *         = people.stream().collect(groupingBy(Person::getCity, TreeMap::new,
     *                                              mapping(Person::getLastName, toSet())));
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @implNote
     * The returned {@code Collector} is not concurrent.  For parallel stream
     * pipelines, the {@code combiner} function operates by merging the keys
     * from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation.  If
     * preservation of the order in which elements are presented to the downstream
     * collector is not required, using {@link #groupingByConcurrent(Function, Supplier, Collector)}
     * may offer better parallel performance.
