     * Compares two {@code Double} objects numerically.  There
     * are two ways in which comparisons performed by this method
     * differ from those performed by the Java language numerical
     * comparison operators ({@code <, <=, ==, >=, >})
     * when applied to primitive {@code double} values:
     * <ul><li>
     *          {@code Double.NaN} is considered by this method
     *          to be equal to itself and greater than all other
     *          {@code double} values (including
     *          {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY}).
     * <li>
     *          {@code 0.0d} is considered by this method to be greater
     *          than {@code -0.0d}.
     * </ul>
     * This ensures that the <i>natural ordering</i> of
     * {@code Double} objects imposed by this method is <i>consistent
     * with equals</i>.
     *
     * @param   anotherDouble   the {@code Double} to be compared.
     * @return  the value {@code 0} if {@code anotherDouble} is
     *          numerically equal to this {@code Double}; a value
     *          less than {@code 0} if this {@code Double}
     *          is numerically less than {@code anotherDouble};
     *          and a value greater than {@code 0} if this
     *          {@code Double} is numerically greater than
     *          {@code anotherDouble}.
