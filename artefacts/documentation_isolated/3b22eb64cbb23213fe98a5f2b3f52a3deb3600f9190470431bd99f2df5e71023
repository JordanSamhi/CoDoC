     * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
     * system clock, converting to date and time using the default time-zone.
     * <p>
     * This clock is based on the best available system clock.
     * This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher resolution
     * clock if one is available.
     * <p>
     * Using this method hard codes a dependency to the default time-zone into your application.
     * It is recommended to avoid this and use a specific time-zone whenever possible.
     * The {@link #systemUTC() UTC clock} should be used when you need the current instant
     * without the date or time.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
     * It is equivalent to {@code system(ZoneId.systemDefault())}.
     *
     * @return a clock that uses the best available system clock in the default zone, not null
     * @see ZoneId#systemDefault()
