     * Returns a reference to an existing {@code FileSystem}.
     *
     * <p> This method iterates over the {@link FileSystemProvider#installedProviders()
     * installed} providers to locate the provider that is identified by the URI
     * {@link URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
     * without regard to case. The exact form of the URI is highly provider
     * dependent. If found, the provider's {@link FileSystemProvider#getFileSystem
     * getFileSystem} method is invoked to obtain a reference to the {@code
     * FileSystem}.
     *
     * <p> Once a file system created by this provider is {@link FileSystem#close
     * closed} it is provider-dependent if this method returns a reference to
     * the closed file system or throws {@link FileSystemNotFoundException}.
     * If the provider allows a new file system to be created with the same URI
     * as a file system it previously created then this method throws the
     * exception if invoked after the file system is closed (and before a new
     * instance is created by the {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method).
     *
     * <p> If a security manager is installed then a provider implementation
     * may require to check a permission before returning a reference to an
     * existing file system. In the case of the {@link FileSystems#getDefault
     * default} file system, no permission check is required.

     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the pre-conditions for the {@code uri} parameter are not met
     * @throws  FileSystemNotFoundException
     *          if the file system, identified by the URI, does not exist
     * @throws  ProviderNotFoundException
     *          if a provider supporting the URI scheme is not installed
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission
