     * Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
     * datagram header for datagrams sent from this DatagramSocket.
     * As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
     * value applications should consider it a hint.
     *
     * <P> The tc <B>must</B> be in the range {@code 0 <= tc <=
     * 255} or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
     * <p>Notes:
     * <p>For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
     * {@code integer}, the least significant 8 bits of which
     * represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
     * the socket.
     * RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:
     *
     * <UL>
     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)</CODE></LI>
     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)</CODE></LI>
     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)</CODE></LI>
     * <LI><CODE>IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)</CODE></LI>
     * </UL>
     * The last low order bit is always ignored as this
     * corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
     * <p>
     * Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
     * SocketException indicating that the operation is not
     * permitted.
     * <p>
     * for Internet Protocol v6 {@code tc} is the value that
     * would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.
     *
     * @param tc        an {@code int} value for the bitset.
     * @throws SocketException if there is an error setting the
     * traffic class or type-of-service
     * @since 1.4
     * @see #getTrafficClass
