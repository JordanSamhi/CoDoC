     * Reads the target of a symbolic link <i>(optional operation)</i>.
     *
     * <p> If the file system supports <a href="package-summary.html#links">symbolic
     * links</a> then this method is used to read the target of the link, failing
     * if the file is not a symbolic link. The target of the link need not exist.
     * The returned {@code Path} object will be associated with the same file
     * system as {@code link}.
     *
     * @param   link
     *          the path to the symbolic link
     *
     * @return  a {@code Path} object representing the target of the link
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the implementation does not support symbolic links
     * @throws  NotLinkException
     *          if the target could otherwise not be read because the file
     *          is not a symbolic link <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
     *          is installed, it checks that {@code FilePermission} has been
     *          granted with the "{@code readlink}" action to read the link.
