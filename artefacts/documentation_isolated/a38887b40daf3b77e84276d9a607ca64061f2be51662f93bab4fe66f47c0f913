     * Returns the {@code Class} object associated with the class or
     * interface with the given string name, using the given class loader.
     * Given the fully qualified name for a class or interface (in the same
     * format returned by {@code getName}) this method attempts to
     * locate, load, and link the class or interface.  The specified class
     * loader is used to load the class or interface.  If the parameter
     * {@code loader} is null, the class is loaded through the bootstrap
     * class loader.  The class is initialized only if the
     * {@code initialize} parameter is {@code true} and if it has
     * not been initialized earlier.
     *
     * <p> If {@code name} denotes a primitive type or void, an attempt
     * will be made to locate a user-defined class in the unnamed package whose
     * name is {@code name}. Therefore, this method cannot be used to
     * obtain any of the {@code Class} objects representing primitive
     * types or void.
     *
     * <p> If {@code name} denotes an array class, the component type of
     * the array class is loaded but not initialized.
     *
     * <p> For example, in an instance method the expression:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code Class.forName("Foo")}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * is equivalent to:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code Class.forName("Foo", true, this.getClass().getClassLoader())}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * Note that this method throws errors related to loading, linking or
     * initializing as specified in Sections 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4 of <em>The
     * Java Language Specification</em>.
     * Note that this method does not check whether the requested class
     * is accessible to its caller.
     *
     * <p> If the {@code loader} is {@code null}, and a security
     * manager is present, and the caller's class loader is not null, then this
     * method calls the security manager's {@code checkPermission} method
     * with a {@code RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")} permission to
     * ensure it's ok to access the bootstrap class loader.
     *
     * @param name       fully qualified name of the desired class
     * @param initialize if {@code true} the class will be initialized.
     *                   See Section 12.4 of <em>The Java Language Specification</em>.
     * @param loader     class loader from which the class must be loaded
     * @return           class object representing the desired class
     *
     * @exception LinkageError if the linkage fails
     * @exception ExceptionInInitializerError if the initialization provoked
     *            by this method fails
     * @exception ClassNotFoundException if the class cannot be located by
     *            the specified class loader
