     * Acquires the lock unless the current thread is
     * {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread and returns
     * immediately, setting the lock hold count to one.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold count
     * is incremented by one and the method returns immediately.
     *
     * <p>If the lock is held by another thread then the
     * current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
     * purposes and lies dormant until one of two things happens:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>The lock is acquired by the current thread; or
     *
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts} the
     * current thread.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>If the lock is acquired by the current thread then the lock hold
     * count is set to one.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     *
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while acquiring
     * the lock,
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
     * interruption point, preference is given to responding to the
     * interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the lock.
     *
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
