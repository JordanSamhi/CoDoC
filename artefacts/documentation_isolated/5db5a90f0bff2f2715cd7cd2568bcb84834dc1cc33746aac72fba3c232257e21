     * Reads the next byte of data from this input stream. The value
     * byte is returned as an <code>int</code> in the range
     * <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. If no byte is available
     * because the end of the stream has been reached, the value
     * <code>-1</code> is returned. This method blocks until input data
     * is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception
     * is thrown.
