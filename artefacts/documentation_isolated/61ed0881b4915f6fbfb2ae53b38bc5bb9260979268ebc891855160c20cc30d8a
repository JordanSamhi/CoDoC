     * Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
     * <p>
     * All fields can be expressed as a {@code long} integer.
     * This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
     * The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
     * If the date-time cannot return the range, because the field is unsupported or for
     * some other reason, an exception will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
     * and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
     * could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in {@link ChronoField}.
     * If the field is supported, then the range of the field must be returned.
     * If unsupported, then an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessorl)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
     * read-only method is invoked.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:
     * <pre>
     *  if (field instanceof ChronoField) {
     *    if (isSupported(field)) {
     *      return field.range();
     *    }
     *    throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Unsupported field: " + field);
     *  }
     *  return field.rangeRefinedBy(this);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param field  the field to query the range for, not null
     * @return the range of valid values for the field, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the range for the field cannot be obtained
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported
