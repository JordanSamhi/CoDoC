     * Make this drawable mutable. This operation cannot be reversed. A mutable
     * drawable is guaranteed to not share its state with any other drawable.
     * This is especially useful when you need to modify properties of drawables
     * loaded from resources. By default, all drawables instances loaded from
     * the same resource share a common state; if you modify the state of one
     * instance, all the other instances will receive the same modification.
     *
     * Calling this method on a mutable Drawable will have no effect.

     * @return This drawable.
