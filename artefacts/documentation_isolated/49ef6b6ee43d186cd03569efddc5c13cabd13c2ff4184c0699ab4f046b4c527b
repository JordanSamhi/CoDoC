     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is completed when this
     * CompletableFuture completes, with the result of the given
     * function of the exception triggering this CompletableFuture's
     * completion when it completes exceptionally; otherwise, if this
     * CompletableFuture completes normally, then the returned
     * CompletableFuture also completes normally with the same value.
     * Note: More flexible versions of this functionality are
     * available using methods {@code whenComplete} and {@code handle}.
     *
     * @param fn the function to use to compute the value of the
     * returned CompletableFuture if this CompletableFuture completed
     * exceptionally
     * @return the new CompletableFuture
