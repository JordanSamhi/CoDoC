     * Gets the era, as defined by the chronology.
     * <p>
     * The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
     * Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
     * However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
     * The exact meaning is determined by the {@code Chronology}.
     * <p>
     * All correctly implemented {@code Era} classes are singletons, thus it
     * is valid code to write {@code date.getEra() == SomeChrono.ERA_NAME)}.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation uses {@link Chronology#eraOf(int)}.
     *
     * @return the chronology specific era constant applicable at this date, not null
