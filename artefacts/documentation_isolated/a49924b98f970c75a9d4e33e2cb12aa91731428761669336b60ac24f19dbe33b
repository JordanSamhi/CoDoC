     * Obtains a {@code Period} consisting of the number of years, months,
     * and days between two dates.
     * <p>
     * The start date is included, but the end date is not.
     * The period is calculated by removing complete months, then calculating
     * the remaining number of days, adjusting to ensure that both have the same sign.
     * The number of months is then split into years and months based on a 12 month year.
     * A month is considered if the end day-of-month is greater than or equal to the start day-of-month.
     * For example, from {@code 2010-01-15} to {@code 2011-03-18} is one year, two months and three days.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method can be a negative period if the end is before the start.
     * The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.
