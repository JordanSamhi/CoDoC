     * Compares two {@code Float} objects numerically.  There are
     * two ways in which comparisons performed by this method differ
     * from those performed by the Java language numerical comparison
     * operators ({@code <, <=, ==, >=, >}) when
     * applied to primitive {@code float} values:
     *
     * <ul><li>
     *          {@code Float.NaN} is considered by this method to
     *          be equal to itself and greater than all other
     *          {@code float} values
     *          (including {@code Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY}).
     * <li>
     *          {@code 0.0f} is considered by this method to be greater
     *          than {@code -0.0f}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * This ensures that the <i>natural ordering</i> of {@code Float}
     * objects imposed by this method is <i>consistent with equals</i>.
     *
     * @param   anotherFloat   the {@code Float} to be compared.
     * @return  the value {@code 0} if {@code anotherFloat} is
     *          numerically equal to this {@code Float}; a value
     *          less than {@code 0} if this {@code Float}
     *          is numerically less than {@code anotherFloat};
     *          and a value greater than {@code 0} if this
     *          {@code Float} is numerically greater than
     *          {@code anotherFloat}.
