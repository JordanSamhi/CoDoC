     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is completed when all of
     * the given CompletableFutures complete.  If any of the given
     * CompletableFutures complete exceptionally, then the returned
     * CompletableFuture also does so, with a CompletionException
     * holding this exception as its cause.  Otherwise, the results,
     * if any, of the given CompletableFutures are not reflected in
     * the returned CompletableFuture, but may be obtained by
     * inspecting them individually. If no CompletableFutures are
     * provided, returns a CompletableFuture completed with the value
     * {@code null}.
     *
     * <p>Among the applications of this method is to await completion
     * of a set of independent CompletableFutures before continuing a
     * program, as in: {@code CompletableFuture.allOf(c1, c2,
     * c3).join();}.
     *
     * @param cfs the CompletableFutures
     * @return a new CompletableFuture that is completed when all of the
     * given CompletableFutures complete
     * @throws NullPointerException if the array or any of its elements are
     * {@code null}
