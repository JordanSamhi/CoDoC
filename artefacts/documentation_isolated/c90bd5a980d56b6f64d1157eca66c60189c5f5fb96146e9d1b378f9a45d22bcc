         * {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
         *
         * <p>Acquires the write lock if neither the read nor write lock
         * are held by another thread
         * and returns immediately, setting the write lock hold count to
         * one.
         *
         * <p>If the current thread already holds this lock then the
         * hold count is incremented by one and the method returns
         * immediately.
         *
         * <p>If the lock is held by another thread then the current
         * thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and
         * lies dormant until one of two things happens:
         *
         * <ul>
         *
         * <li>The write lock is acquired by the current thread; or
         *
         * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
         * the current thread.
         *
         * </ul>
         *
         * <p>If the write lock is acquired by the current thread then the
         * lock hold count is set to one.
         *
         * <p>If the current thread:
         *
         * <ul>
         *
         * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method;
         * or
         *
         * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while
         * acquiring the write lock,
         *
         * </ul>
         *
         * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current
         * thread's interrupted status is cleared.
         *
         * <p>In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
         * interruption point, preference is given to responding to
         * the interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the
         * lock.
         *
         * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
