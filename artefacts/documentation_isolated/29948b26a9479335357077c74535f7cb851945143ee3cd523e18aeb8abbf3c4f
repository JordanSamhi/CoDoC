     * Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished
     * name in the {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
     * distinguished names.
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names
     * which {@code X509CRLs} may contain. The specified name is added to
     * any previous value for the issuerNames criterion. If the specified name
     * is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
     * If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER
     * encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for
     * this structure is as follows.
     * <p>
     * The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
     * a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1
     * notation for this structure appears in the documentation for
     * {@link #setIssuerNames setIssuerNames(Collection names)}.
     * <p>
     * Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
     * subsequent modifications.
     *
     * @param name a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form
     * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
