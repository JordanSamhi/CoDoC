     * Convenience method to set the {@code accessible} flag for an
     * array of objects with a single security check (for efficiency).
     *
     * <p>First, if there is a security manager, its
     * {@code checkPermission} method is called with a
     * {@code ReflectPermission("suppressAccessChecks")} permission.
     *
     * <p>A {@code SecurityException} is raised if {@code flag} is
     * {@code true} but accessibility of any of the elements of the input
     * {@code array} may not be changed (for example, if the element
     * object is a {@link Constructor} object for the class {@link
     * java.lang.Class}).  In the event of such a SecurityException, the
     * accessibility of objects is set to {@code flag} for array elements
     * upto (and excluding) the element for which the exception occurred; the
     * accessibility of elements beyond (and including) the element for which
     * the exception occurred is unchanged.
     *
     * @param array the array of AccessibleObjects
     * @param flag  the new value for the {@code accessible} flag
     *              in each object
     * @throws SecurityException if the request is denied.
