     * Walks a file tree.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * walkFileTree(start, EnumSet.noneOf(FileVisitOption.class), Integer.MAX_VALUE, visitor)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * In other words, it does not follow symbolic links, and visits all levels
     * of the file tree.
     *
     * @param   start
     *          the starting file
     * @param   visitor
     *          the file visitor to invoke for each file
     *
     * @return  the starting file
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
     *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead} method is invoked
     *          to check read access to the directory.
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error is thrown by a visitor method
