     * Method to find a named logger.
     * <p>
     * Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with
     * arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to
     * find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
     * It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the
     * String {@code name} may be garbage collected at any time if there
     * is no strong reference to the Logger. The caller of this method
     * must check the return value for null in order to properly handle
     * the case where the Logger has been garbage collected.
     * <p>
     * @param name name of the logger
     * @return  matching logger or null if none is found
