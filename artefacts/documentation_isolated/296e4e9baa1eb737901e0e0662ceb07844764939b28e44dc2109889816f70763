     * Ask the transport for an Intent that can be used to launch a more detailed
     * secondary data management activity.  For example, the configuration intent might
     * be one for allowing the user to select which account they wish to associate
     * their backups with, and the management intent might be one which presents a
     * UI for managing the data on the backend.
     *
     * <p>In the Settings UI, the configuration intent will typically be invoked
     * when the user taps on the preferences item labeled with the current
     * destination string, and the management intent will be placed in an overflow
     * menu labelled with the management label string.
     *
     * <p>If the transport does not supply any user-facing data management
     * UI, then it should return {@code null} from this method.
     *
     * @return An intent that can be passed to Context.startActivity() in order to
     * launch the transport's data-management UI.  This method will return
     * {@code null} if the transport does not offer any user-facing data
     * management UI.
