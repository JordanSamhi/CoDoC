     * Returns the hash code value for this bit set. The hash code depends
     * only on which bits are set within this {@code BitSet}.
     *
     * <p>The hash code is defined to be the result of the following
     * calculation:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * public int hashCode() {
     *     long h = 1234;
     *     long[] words = toLongArray();
     *     for (int i = words.length; --i >= 0; )
     *         h ^= words[i] * (i + 1);
     *     return (int)((h >> 32) ^ h);
     * }}</pre>
     * Note that the hash code changes if the set of bits is altered.
     *
     * @return the hash code value for this bit set
