     * Obtains an instance of {@code Date} from an {@code Instant} object.
     * <p>
     * {@code Instant} uses a precision of nanoseconds, whereas {@code Date}
     * uses a precision of milliseconds.  The conversion will trancate any
     * excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds was
     * subject to integer division by one million.
     * <p>
     * {@code Instant} can store points on the time-line further in the future
     * and further in the past than {@code Date}. In this scenario, this method
     * will throw an exception.
     *
     * @param instant  the instant to convert
     * @return a {@code Date} representing the same point on the time-line as
     *  the provided instant
     * @exception NullPointerException if {@code instant} is null.
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the instant is too large to
     *  represent as a {@code Date}
