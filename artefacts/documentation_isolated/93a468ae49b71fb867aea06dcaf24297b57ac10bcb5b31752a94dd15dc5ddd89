     * Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The
     * {@code X509Certificate} must contain all or at least one
     * of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of
     * the matchAllNames flag (see {@link #setMatchAllSubjectAltNames
     * setMatchAllSubjectAltNames}).
     * <p>
     * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject
     * alternative names.
     * The specified name is added to any previous value for the
     * subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a
     * duplicate, it may be ignored.
     * <p>
     * The name is provided in string format.
     * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</a>, DNS, and URI
     * names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to
     * the restrictions included in RFC 3280). IPv4 address names are
     * supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented
     * as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And
     * directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format.
     * No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names,
     * EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They
     * should be specified using the
     * {@link #addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)
     * addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)}
     * method.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> for distinguished names, use
     * {@linkplain #addSubjectAlternativeName(int, byte[])} instead.
     * This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some
     * certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253
     * String form of some distinguished names.
     *
     * @param type the name type (0-8, as specified in
     *             RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.7)
     * @param name the name in string form (not {@code null})
     * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
