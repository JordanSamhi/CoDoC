     * Play a sound from a sound ID.
     *
     * Play the sound specified by the soundID. This is the value
     * returned by the load() function. Returns a non-zero streamID
     * if successful, zero if it fails. The streamID can be used to
     * further control playback. Note that calling play() may cause
     * another sound to stop playing if the maximum number of active
     * streams is exceeded. A loop value of -1 means loop forever,
     * a value of 0 means don't loop, other values indicate the
     * number of repeats, e.g. a value of 1 plays the audio twice.
     * The playback rate allows the application to vary the playback
     * rate (pitch) of the sound. A value of 1.0 means play back at
     * the original frequency. A value of 2.0 means play back twice
     * as fast, and a value of 0.5 means playback at half speed.
