     * Returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified
     * index. The index refers to {@code char} values
     * (Unicode code units) and ranges from {@code 0} to
     * {@link #length()}{@code  - 1}.
     *
     * <p> If the {@code char} value specified at the given index
     * is in the high-surrogate range, the following index is less
     * than the length of this {@code String}, and the
     * {@code char} value at the following index is in the
     * low-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point
     * corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise,
     * the {@code char} value at the given index is returned.
     *
     * @param      index the index to the {@code char} values
     * @return     the code point value of the character at the
     *             {@code index}
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException  if the {@code index}
     *             argument is negative or not less than the length of this
     *             string.
