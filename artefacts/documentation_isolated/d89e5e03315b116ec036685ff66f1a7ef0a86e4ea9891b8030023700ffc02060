     * Finds or creates an instance of a method type, given the spelling of its bytecode descriptor.
     * Convenience method for {@link #methodType(java.lang.Class, java.lang.Class[]) methodType}.
     * Any class or interface name embedded in the descriptor string
     * will be resolved by calling {@link ClassLoader#loadClass(java.lang.String)}
     * on the given loader (or if it is null, on the system class loader).
     * <p>
     * Note that it is possible to encounter method types which cannot be
     * constructed by this method, because their component types are
     * not all reachable from a common class loader.
     * <p>
     * This method is included for the benefit of applications that must
     * generate bytecodes that process method handles and {@code invokedynamic}.
     * @param descriptor a bytecode-level type descriptor string "(T...)T"
     * @param loader the class loader in which to look up the types
     * @return a method type matching the bytecode-level type descriptor
     * @throws NullPointerException if the string is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the string is not well-formed
     * @throws TypeNotPresentException if a named type cannot be found
