     * Returns the canonical pathname string of this abstract pathname.
     *
     * <p> A canonical pathname is both absolute and unique.  The precise
     * definition of canonical form is system-dependent.  This method first
     * converts this pathname to absolute form if necessary, as if by invoking the
     * {@link #getAbsolutePath} method, and then maps it to its unique form in a
     * system-dependent way.  This typically involves removing redundant names
     * such as <tt>"."</tt> and <tt>".."</tt> from the pathname, resolving
     * symbolic links (on UNIX platforms), and converting drive letters to a
     * standard case (on Microsoft Windows platforms).
     *
     * <p> Every pathname that denotes an existing file or directory has a
     * unique canonical form.  Every pathname that denotes a nonexistent file
     * or directory also has a unique canonical form.  The canonical form of
     * the pathname of a nonexistent file or directory may be different from
     * the canonical form of the same pathname after the file or directory is
     * created.  Similarly, the canonical form of the pathname of an existing
     * file or directory may be different from the canonical form of the same
     * pathname after the file or directory is deleted.
     *
     * @return  The canonical pathname string denoting the same file or
     *          directory as this abstract pathname
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If an I/O error occurs, which is possible because the
     *          construction of the canonical pathname may require
     *          filesystem queries
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a required system property value cannot be accessed, or
     *          if a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
     *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkRead}</code> method denies
     *          read access to the file
