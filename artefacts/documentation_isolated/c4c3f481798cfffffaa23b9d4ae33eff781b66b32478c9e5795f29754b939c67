     * Searches a range of
     * the specified array for the specified object using the binary
     * search algorithm.
     * The range must be sorted into ascending order
     * according to the
     * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}
     * of its elements (as by the
     * {@link #sort(Object[], int, int)} method) prior to making this
     * call.  If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.
     * (If the range contains elements that are not mutually comparable (for
     * example, strings and integers), it <i>cannot</i> be sorted according
     * to the natural ordering of its elements, hence results are undefined.)
     * If the range contains multiple
     * elements equal to the specified object, there is no guarantee which
     * one will be found.
     *
     * @param a the array to be searched
     * @param fromIndex the index of the first element (inclusive) to be
     *          searched
     * @param toIndex the index of the last element (exclusive) to be searched
     * @param key the value to be searched for
     * @return index of the search key, if it is contained in the array
     *         within the specified range;
     *         otherwise, <tt>(-(<i>insertion point</i>) - 1)</tt>.  The
     *         <i>insertion point</i> is defined as the point at which the
     *         key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first
     *         element in the range greater than the key,
     *         or <tt>toIndex</tt> if all
     *         elements in the range are less than the specified key.  Note
     *         that this guarantees that the return value will be &gt;= 0 if
     *         and only if the key is found.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the search key is not comparable to the
     *         elements of the array within the specified range.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *         if {@code fromIndex > toIndex}
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
     *         if {@code fromIndex < 0 or toIndex > a.length}
