     * clipRect() and clipPath() which transform their arguments by the
     * current matrix, clipRegion() assumes its argument is already in the
     * coordinate system of the current layer's bitmap, and so not
     * transformation is performed.

     * @deprecated Unlike all other clip calls this API does not respect the
     *             current matrix. Use {@link #clipRect(Rect)} as an alternative.
