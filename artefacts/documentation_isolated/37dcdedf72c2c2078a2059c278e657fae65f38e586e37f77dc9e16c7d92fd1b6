     * Returns the index within this {@code String} that is
     * offset from the given {@code index} by
     * {@code codePointOffset} code points. Unpaired surrogates
     * within the text range given by {@code index} and
     * {@code codePointOffset} count as one code point each.
     *
     * @param index the index to be offset
     * @param codePointOffset the offset in code points
     * @return the index within this {@code String}
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if {@code index}
     *   is negative or larger then the length of this
     *   {@code String}, or if {@code codePointOffset} is positive
     *   and the substring starting with {@code index} has fewer
     *   than {@code codePointOffset} code points,
     *   or if {@code codePointOffset} is negative and the substring
     *   before {@code index} has fewer than the absolute value
     *   of {@code codePointOffset} code points.
