     * <p> This method may only be invoked if this channel's socket is
     * connected, and it only accepts datagrams from the socket's peer.  If
     * there are more bytes in the datagram than remain in the given buffers
     * then the remainder of the datagram is silently discarded.  Otherwise
     * this method behaves exactly as specified in the {@link
     * ScatteringByteChannel} interface.  </p>

     * @throws  NotYetConnectedException
     *          If this channel's socket is not connected
