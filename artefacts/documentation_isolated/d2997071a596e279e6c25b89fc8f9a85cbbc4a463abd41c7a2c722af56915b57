     * Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
     * they're not already present.  If the specified collection is also a
     * set, the {@code addAll} operation effectively modifies this set so
     * that its value is the <i>union</i> of the two sets.  The behavior of
     * this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified
     * while the operation is in progress.

     * @param  c collection containing elements to be added to this set

     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified collection is null
