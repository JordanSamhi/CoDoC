     * Returns a hash code for this {@code Double} object. The
     * result is the exclusive OR of the two halves of the
     * {@code long} integer bit representation, exactly as
     * produced by the method {@link #doubleToLongBits(double)}, of
     * the primitive {@code double} value represented by this
     * {@code Double} object. That is, the hash code is the value
     * of the expression:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code (int)(v^(v>>>32))}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * where {@code v} is defined by:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code long v = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.doubleValue());}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @return  a {@code hash code} value for this object.
