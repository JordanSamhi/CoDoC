     * Writes <code>len</code> bytes from the specified byte array
     * starting at offset <code>off</code> to this buffered output stream.
     *
     * <p> Ordinarily this method stores bytes from the given array into this
     * stream's buffer, flushing the buffer to the underlying output stream as
     * needed.  If the requested length is at least as large as this stream's
     * buffer, however, then this method will flush the buffer and write the
     * bytes directly to the underlying output stream.  Thus redundant
     * <code>BufferedOutputStream</code>s will not copy data unnecessarily.
     *
     * @param      b     the data.
     * @param      off   the start offset in the data.
     * @param      len   the number of bytes to write.
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
