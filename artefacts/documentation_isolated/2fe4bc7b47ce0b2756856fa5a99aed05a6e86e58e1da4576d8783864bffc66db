     * Returns the code point at the given index of the

     * the given index in the {@code CharSequence} is in the
     * high-surrogate range, the following index is less than the
     * length of the {@code CharSequence}, and the
     * {@code char} value at the following index is in the
     * low-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point
     * corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise,
     * the {@code char} value at the given index is returned.

     * @param seq a sequence of {@code char} values (Unicode code
     * units)
