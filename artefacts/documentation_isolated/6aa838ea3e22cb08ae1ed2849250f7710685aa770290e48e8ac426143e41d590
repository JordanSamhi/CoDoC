     * Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the <em>natural
     * ordering</em> on a collection of objects that implement the
     * {@code Comparable} interface.  (The natural ordering is the ordering
     * imposed by the objects' own {@code compareTo} method.)  This enables a
     * simple idiom for sorting (or maintaining) collections (or arrays) of
     * objects that implement the {@code Comparable} interface in
     * reverse-natural-order.  For example, suppose {@code a} is an array of
     * strings. Then: <pre>
     *          Arrays.sort(a, Collections.reverseOrder());
     * </pre> sorts the array in reverse-lexicographic (alphabetical) order.<p>
     *
     * The returned comparator is serializable.

     * @return A comparator that imposes the reverse of the <i>natural

     *         the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface.
