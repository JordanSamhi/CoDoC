     * Reads the target of a symbolic link. This method works in exactly the
     * manner specified by the {@link Files#readSymbolicLink} method.
     *
     * <p> The default implementation of this method throws {@code
     * UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * @param   link
     *          the path to the symbolic link
     *
     * @return  The target of the symbolic link
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the implementation does not support symbolic links
     * @throws  NotLinkException
     *          if the target could otherwise not be read because the file
     *          is not a symbolic link <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager
     *          is installed, it checks that {@code FilePermission} has been
     *          granted with the "{@code readlink}" action to read the link.
