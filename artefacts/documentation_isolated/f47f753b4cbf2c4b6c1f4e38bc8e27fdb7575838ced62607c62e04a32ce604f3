     * <p> Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or
     * <i>put</i> operations to fill this buffer.  For example:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * buf.clear();     // Prepare buffer for reading
     * in.read(buf);    // Read data</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p> This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
     * is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
     * in which that might as well be the case. </p>
     *
     * @return  This buffer
