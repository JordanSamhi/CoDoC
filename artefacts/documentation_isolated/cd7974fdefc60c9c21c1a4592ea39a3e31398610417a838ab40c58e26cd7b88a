     * Registers this channel with the given selector, returning a selection key.
     *
     * <p>  This method first verifies that this channel is open and that the
     * given initial interest set is valid.
     *
     * <p> If this channel is already registered with the given selector then
     * the selection key representing that registration is returned after
     * setting its interest set to the given value.
     *
     * <p> Otherwise this channel has not yet been registered with the given
     * selector, so the {@link AbstractSelector#register register} method of
     * the selector is invoked while holding the appropriate locks.  The
     * resulting key is added to this channel's key set before being returned.
     * </p>
