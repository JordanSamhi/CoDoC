     * Sets a {@code List} of additional certification path checkers. If
     * the specified {@code List} contains an object that is not a
     * {@code PKIXCertPathChecker}, it is ignored.
     * <p>
     * Each {@code PKIXCertPathChecker} specified implements
     * additional checks on a certificate. Typically, these are checks to
     * process and verify private extensions contained in certificates.
     * Each {@code PKIXCertPathChecker} should be instantiated with any
     * initialization parameters needed to execute the check.
     * <p>
     * This method allows sophisticated applications to extend a PKIX
     * {@code CertPathValidator} or {@code CertPathBuilder}.
     * Each of the specified {@code PKIXCertPathChecker}s will be called,
     * in turn, by a PKIX {@code CertPathValidator} or
     * {@code CertPathBuilder} for each certificate processed or
     * validated.
     * <p>
     * Regardless of whether these additional {@code PKIXCertPathChecker}s
     * are set, a PKIX {@code CertPathValidator} or
     * {@code CertPathBuilder} must perform all of the required PKIX
     * checks on each certificate. The one exception to this rule is if the
     * RevocationEnabled flag is set to false (see the {@link
     * #setRevocationEnabled setRevocationEnabled} method).
     * <p>
     * Note that the {@code List} supplied here is copied and each
     * {@code PKIXCertPathChecker} in the list is cloned to protect
     * against subsequent modifications.
