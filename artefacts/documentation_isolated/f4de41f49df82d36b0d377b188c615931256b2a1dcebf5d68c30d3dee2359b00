     * Returns a copy of this year-month with the specified field set to a new value.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code YearMonth}, based on this one, with the value
     * for the specified field changed.
     * This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year or month.
     * If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
     * some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
     * The supported fields behave as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code YearMonth} with the specified month-of-year.
     *  The year will be unchanged.
     * <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} -
     *  Returns a {@code YearMonth} with the specified proleptic-month.
     *  This completely replaces the year and month of this object.
     * <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} -
     *  Returns a {@code YearMonth} with the specified year-of-era
     *  The month and era will be unchanged.
     * <li>{@code YEAR} -
     *  Returns a {@code YearMonth} with the specified year.
     *  The month will be unchanged.
     * <li>{@code ERA} -
     *  Returns a {@code YearMonth} with the specified era.
     *  The month and year-of-era will be unchanged.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In all cases, if the new value is outside the valid range of values for the field
     * then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
     * <p>
     * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the field determines
     * whether and how to adjust the instant.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param field  the field to set in the result, not null
     * @param newValue  the new value of the field in the result
     * @return a {@code YearMonth} based on {@code this} with the specified field set, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the field cannot be set
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
