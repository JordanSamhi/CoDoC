     * Extracts the array of SubjectAlt DNS names from an X509Certificate.
     * Returns null if there aren't any.

     * from the SubjectAlts.  It can only extract international characters
     * from the CN field.

     * international characters correctly in the SubjectAlts?).

     * @param cert X509Certificate
