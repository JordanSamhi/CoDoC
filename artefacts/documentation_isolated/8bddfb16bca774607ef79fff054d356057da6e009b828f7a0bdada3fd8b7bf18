     * Gets the local transition date-time, as would be expressed with the 'before' offset.
     * <p>
     * This is the date-time where the discontinuity begins expressed with the 'before' offset.
     * At this instant, the 'after' offset is actually used, therefore the combination of this
     * date-time and the 'before' offset will never occur.
     * <p>
     * The combination of the 'before' date-time and offset represents the same instant
     * as the 'after' date-time and offset.

     * @return the transition date-time expressed with the before offset, not null
