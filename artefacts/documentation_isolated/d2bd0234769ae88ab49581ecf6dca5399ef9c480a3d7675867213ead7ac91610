     * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount added.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the amount
     * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
     * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented here.
     * The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.
     * The calculation for date and time units differ.
     * <p>
     * Date units operate on the local time-line.
     * The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back
     * to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
     * The conversion uses {@link #ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}
     * with the offset before the addition.
     * <p>
     * Time units operate on the instant time-line.
     * The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back to
     * a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
     * The conversion uses {@link #ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)}
     * with the offset before the addition.
     * <p>
     * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
     * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
     * whether and how to perform the addition.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
