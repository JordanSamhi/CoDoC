     * Returns the cause of this throwable or {@code null} if the
     * cause is nonexistent or unknown.  (The cause is the throwable that
     * caused this throwable to get thrown.)
     *
     * <p>This implementation returns the cause that was supplied via one of
     * the constructors requiring a {@code Throwable}, or that was set after
     * creation with the {@link #initCause(Throwable)} method.  While it is
     * typically unnecessary to override this method, a subclass can override
     * it to return a cause set by some other means.  This is appropriate for
     * a "legacy chained throwable" that predates the addition of chained
     * exceptions to {@code Throwable}.  Note that it is <i>not</i>
     * necessary to override any of the {@code PrintStackTrace} methods,
     * all of which invoke the {@code getCause} method to determine the
     * cause of a throwable.
     *
     * @return  the cause of this throwable or {@code null} if the
     *          cause is nonexistent or unknown.
