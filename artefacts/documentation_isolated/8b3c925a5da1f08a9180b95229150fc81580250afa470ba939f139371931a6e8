     * Constructs cookies from set-cookie or set-cookie2 header string.
     * RFC 2965 section 3.2.2 set-cookie2 syntax indicates that one header line
     * may contain more than one cookie definitions, so this is a static
     * utility method instead of another constructor.
     *
     * @param  header
     *         a {@code String} specifying the set-cookie header. The header
     *         should start with "set-cookie", or "set-cookie2" token; or it
     *         should have no leading token at all.
     *
     * @return  a List of cookie parsed from header line string
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if header string violates the cookie specification's syntax or
     *          the cookie name contains illegal characters.
     * @throws  NullPointerException
     *          if the header string is {@code null}
