     * Performs an action when method {@link #tryComplete} is invoked
     * and the pending count is zero, or when the unconditional
     * method {@link #complete} is invoked.  By default, this method
     * does nothing. You can distinguish cases by checking the
     * identity of the given caller argument. If not equal to {@code
     * this}, then it is typically a subtask that may contain results
     * (and/or links to other results) to combine.
     *
     * @param caller the task invoking this method (which may
     * be this task itself)
