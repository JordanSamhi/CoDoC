     * Returns a hash code for this {@code Long}. The result is
     * the exclusive OR of the two halves of the primitive
     * {@code long} value held by this {@code Long}
     * object. That is, the hashcode is the value of the expression:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code (int)(this.longValue()^(this.longValue()>>>32))}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * @return  a hash code value for this object.
