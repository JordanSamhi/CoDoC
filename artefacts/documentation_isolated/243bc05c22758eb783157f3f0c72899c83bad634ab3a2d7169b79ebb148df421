     * Obtains an instance of {@code LocalDateTime} from a temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This obtains a local date-time based on the specified temporal.
     * A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
     * which this factory converts to an instance of {@code LocalDateTime}.
     * <p>
     * The conversion extracts and combines the {@code LocalDate} and the
     * {@code LocalTime} from the temporal object.
     * Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
     * those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.
     * <p>
     * This method matches the signature of the functional interface {@link TemporalQuery}
     * allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, {@code LocalDateTime::from}.
     *
     * @param temporal  the temporal object to convert, not null
     * @return the local date-time, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to convert to a {@code LocalDateTime}
