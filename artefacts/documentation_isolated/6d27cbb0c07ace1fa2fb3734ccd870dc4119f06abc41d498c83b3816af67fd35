     * Returns a copy of this {@code LocalDateTime} with the specified number of months added.
     * <p>
     * This method adds the specified amount to the months field in three steps:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Add the input months to the month-of-year field</li>
     * <li>Check if the resulting date would be invalid</li>
     * <li>Adjust the day-of-month to the last valid day if necessary</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * For example, 2007-03-31 plus one month would result in the invalid date
     * 2007-04-31. Instead of returning an invalid result, the last valid day
     * of the month, 2007-04-30, is selected instead.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param months  the months to add, may be negative
     * @return a {@code LocalDateTime} based on this date-time with the months added, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
