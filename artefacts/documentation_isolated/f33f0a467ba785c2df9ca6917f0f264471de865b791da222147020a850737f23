     * <p>Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a
     * negative one.
     *
     * <p>If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
     * input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false
     * and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the
     * match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no
     * meaning.

     * @return  true iff more input could change a positive match into a
