     * Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire the read or
     * write lock. Note that because cancellations may occur at any
     * time, a {@code true} return does not guarantee that any other
     * thread will ever acquire a lock.  This method is designed
     * primarily for use in monitoring of the system state.

     * @return {@code true} if there may be other threads waiting to
     *         acquire the lock
