     * Checks if this date-time is before the specified date-time ignoring the chronology.
     * <p>
     * This method differs from the comparison in {@link #compareTo} in that it
     * only compares the underlying date-time and not the chronology.
     * This allows dates in different calendar systems to be compared based
     * on the time-line position.
     * <p>
     * This default implementation performs the comparison based on the epoch-day
     * and nano-of-day.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return true if this is before the specified date-time
