     * Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent
     * call to the <code>reset</code> method repositions this stream at
     * the last marked position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.
     * <p>
     * The <code>readlimit</code> argument tells this input stream to
     * allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
     * invalidated.
     * <p>
     * This method simply performs <code>in.mark(readlimit)</code>.
     *
     * @param   readlimit   the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
     *                      the mark position becomes invalid.
