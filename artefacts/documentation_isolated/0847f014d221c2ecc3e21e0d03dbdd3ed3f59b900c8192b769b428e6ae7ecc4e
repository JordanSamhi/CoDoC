     * Some protocols do caching of documents.  Occasionally, it is important
     * to be able to "tunnel through" and ignore the caches (e.g., the
     * "reload" button in a browser).  If the UseCaches flag on a connection
     * is true, the connection is allowed to use whatever caches it can.
     *  If false, caches are to be ignored.
     *  The default value comes from DefaultUseCaches, which defaults to
     * true.

     * @param usecaches a {@code boolean} indicating whether
     * or not to allow caching
