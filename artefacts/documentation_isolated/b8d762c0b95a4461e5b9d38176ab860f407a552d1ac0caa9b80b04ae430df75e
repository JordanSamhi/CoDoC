     * <p> After a sequence of channel-read or <i>put</i> operations, invoke
     * this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative
     * <i>get</i> operations.  For example:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * buf.put(magic);    // Prepend header
     * in.read(buf);      // Read data into rest of buffer
     * buf.flip();        // Flip buffer
     * out.write(buf);    // Write header + data to channel</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p> This method is often used in conjunction with the {@link
     * java.nio.ByteBuffer#compact compact} method when transferring data from
     * one place to another.  </p>
