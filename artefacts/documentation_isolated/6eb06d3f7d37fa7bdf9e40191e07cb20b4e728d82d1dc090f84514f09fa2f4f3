     * Compares the specified Object with this Vector for equality.  Returns
     * true if and only if the specified Object is also a List, both Lists
     * have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
     * Lists are <em>equal</em>.  (Two elements {@code e1} and
     * {@code e2} are <em>equal</em> if {@code (e1==null ? e2==null :
     * e1.equals(e2))}.)  In other words, two Lists are defined to be
     * equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.

     * @param o the Object to be compared for equality with this Vector
     * @return true if the specified Object is equal to this Vector
