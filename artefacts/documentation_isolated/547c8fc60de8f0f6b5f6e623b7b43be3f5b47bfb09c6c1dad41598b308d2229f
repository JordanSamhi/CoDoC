     * Apply the given pattern to this Format object.  A pattern is a
     * short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.
     * These properties can also be changed individually through the
     * various setter methods.
     * <p>
     * There is no limit to integer digits set
     * by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
     * use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
     * For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon
     * <P>Example <code>"#,#00.0#"</code> &rarr; 1,234.56
     * <P>This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
     * a maximum of 2 fraction digits.
     * <p>Example: <code>"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"</code> for negatives in
     * parentheses.
     * <p>In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
     * these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.
     *
     * @param pattern a new pattern
     * @exception NullPointerException if <code>pattern</code> is null
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the given pattern is invalid.
