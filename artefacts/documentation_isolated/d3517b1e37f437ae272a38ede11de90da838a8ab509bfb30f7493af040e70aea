     * Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
     * skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next
     * caller of a method for this input stream. The next caller might be
     * the same thread or another thread.  A single read or skip of this
     * many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the result of {@link #in in}.available().

     * @return     an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
     *             over) from this input stream without blocking.
