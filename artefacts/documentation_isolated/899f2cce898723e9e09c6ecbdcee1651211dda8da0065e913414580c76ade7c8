     * Constructs a new file system that is identified by a {@link URI}
     *
     * <p> This method iterates over the {@link FileSystemProvider#installedProviders()
     * installed} providers to locate the provider that is identified by the URI
     * {@link URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
     * without regard to case. The exact form of the URI is highly provider
     * dependent. If found, the provider's {@link FileSystemProvider#newFileSystem(URI,Map)
     * newFileSystem(URI,Map)} method is invoked to construct the new file system.
     *
     * <p> Once a file system is {@link FileSystem#close closed} it is
     * provider-dependent if the provider allows a new file system to be created
     * with the same URI as a file system it previously created.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
     * Suppose there is a provider identified by the scheme {@code "memory"}
     * installed:
     * <pre>
     *   Map&lt;String,String&gt; env = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
     *   env.put("capacity", "16G");
     *   env.put("blockSize", "4k");
     *   FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(URI.create("memory:///?name=logfs"), env);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   uri
     *          the URI identifying the file system
     * @param   env
     *          a map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
     *          may be empty
     *
     * @return  a new file system
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the pre-conditions for the {@code uri} parameter are not met,
     *          or the {@code env} parameter does not contain properties required
     *          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
     * @throws  FileSystemAlreadyExistsException
     *          if the file system has already been created
     * @throws  ProviderNotFoundException
     *          if a provider supporting the URI scheme is not installed
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs creating the file system
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
     *          permission required by the file system provider implementation
