     * Reads a {@code double} from this file. This method reads a
     * {@code long} value, starting at the current file pointer,
     * as if by the {@code readLong} method
     * and then converts that {@code long} to a {@code double}
     * using the {@code longBitsToDouble} method in
     * class {@code Double}.
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the eight bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next eight bytes of this file, interpreted as a
     *             {@code double}.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file reaches the end before reading
     *             eight bytes.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
