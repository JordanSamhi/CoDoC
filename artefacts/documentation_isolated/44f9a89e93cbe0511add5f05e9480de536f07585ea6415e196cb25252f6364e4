     * Log a lazily constructed message, with associated Throwable information.
     * <p>
     * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the
     * message is constructed by invoking the provided supplier function. The
     * message and the given {@link Throwable} are then stored in a {@link
     * LogRecord} which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.
     * <p>
     * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
     * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus it is
     * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
     * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
     * <p>
     * @param   level   One of the message level identifiers, e.g., SEVERE
     * @param   thrown  Throwable associated with log message.
     * @param   msgSupplier   A function, which when called, produces the
     *                        desired log message
