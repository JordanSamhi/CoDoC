     * Returns an array containing {@code Method} objects reflecting all the
     * declared methods of the class or interface represented by this {@code
     * Class} object, including public, protected, default (package)
     * access, and private methods, but excluding inherited methods.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a type that has multiple
     * declared methods with the same name and parameter types, but different
     * return types, then the returned array has a {@code Method} object for
     * each such method.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a type that has a class
     * initialization method {@code <clinit>}, then the returned array does
     * <em>not</em> have a corresponding {@code Method} object.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents a class or interface with no
     * declared methods, then the returned array has length 0.
     *
     * <p> If this {@code Class} object represents an array type, a primitive
     * type, or void, then the returned array has length 0.
     *
     * <p> The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any
     * particular order.
