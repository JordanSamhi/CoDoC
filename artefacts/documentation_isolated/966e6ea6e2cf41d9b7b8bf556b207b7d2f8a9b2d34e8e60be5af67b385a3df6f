     * Compares this date-time to another date-time.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is primarily based on the date-time, from earliest to latest.
     * It is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     * <p>
     * If all the date-times being compared are instances of {@code LocalDateTime},
     * then the comparison will be entirely based on the date-time.
     * If some dates being compared are in different chronologies, then the
     * chronology is also considered, see {@link ChronoLocalDateTime#compareTo}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date-time to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
