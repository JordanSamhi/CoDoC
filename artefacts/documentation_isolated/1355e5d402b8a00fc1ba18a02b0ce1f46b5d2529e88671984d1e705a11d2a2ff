     * <p> The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not
     * a guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these
     * bytes.  The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be
     * accurate immediately after this call.  It is likely to be made
     * inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made
     * on the system outside of this virtual machine.  This method
     * makes no guarantee that write operations to this file system
     * will succeed.

     *          if the abstract pathname does not name a partition.  This
     *          value will be less than or equal to the total file system size
