     * Acquires in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted.
     * Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking
     * at least once {@link #tryAcquire}, returning on
     * success.  Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly
     * blocking and unblocking, invoking {@link #tryAcquire}
     * until success or the thread is interrupted.  This method can be
     * used to implement method {@link Lock#lockInterruptibly}.
     *
     * @param arg the acquire argument.  This value is conveyed to
     *        {@link #tryAcquire} but is otherwise uninterpreted and
     *        can represent anything you like.
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
