     * Returns the first floating-point argument with the sign of the
     * second floating-point argument.  Note that unlike the {@link
     * StrictMath#copySign(double, double) StrictMath.copySign}
     * method, this method does not require NaN {@code sign}
     * arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are
     * permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN
     * arguments as negative to allow greater performance.
     *
     * @param magnitude  the parameter providing the magnitude of the result
     * @param sign   the parameter providing the sign of the result
     * @return a value with the magnitude of {@code magnitude}
     * and the sign of {@code sign}.
     * @since 1.6
