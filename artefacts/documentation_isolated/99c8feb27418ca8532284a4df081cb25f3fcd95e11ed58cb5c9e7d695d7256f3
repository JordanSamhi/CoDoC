     * Returns the value of the named field parsed as date.
     * The result is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 GMT
     * represented by the named field.
     * <p>
     * This form of {@code getHeaderField} exists because some
     * connection types (e.g., {@code http-ng}) have pre-parsed
     * headers. Classes for that connection type can override this method
     * and short-circuit the parsing.
     *
     * @param   name     the name of the header field.
     * @param   Default   a default value.
     * @return  the value of the field, parsed as a date. The value of the
     *          {@code Default} argument is returned if the field is
     *          missing or malformed.
