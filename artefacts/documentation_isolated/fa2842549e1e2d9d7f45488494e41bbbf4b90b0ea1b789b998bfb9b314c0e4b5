     * Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} from the instant formed by combining
     * the local date-time and offset.
     * <p>
     * This creates a zoned date-time by {@link LocalDateTime#toInstant(ZoneOffset) combining}
     * the {@code LocalDateTime} and {@code ZoneOffset}.
     * This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity.
     * <p>
     * Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
     * offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified,
     * then the date-time and offset of the zoned date-time will differ from those specified.
     * <p>
     * If the {@code ZoneId} to be used is a {@code ZoneOffset}, this method is equivalent
     * to {@link #of(LocalDateTime, ZoneId)}.
     *
     * @param localDateTime  the local date-time, not null
     * @param offset  the zone offset, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, not null
     * @return the zoned date-time, not null
