     * Copies into the specified array every active thread in the current
     * thread's thread group and its subgroups. This method simply
     * invokes the {@link java.lang.ThreadGroup#enumerate(Thread[])}
     * method of the current thread's thread group.
     *
     * <p> An application might use the {@linkplain #activeCount activeCount}
     * method to get an estimate of how big the array should be, however
     * <i>if the array is too short to hold all the threads, the extra threads
     * are silently ignored.</i>  If it is critical to obtain every active
     * thread in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups, the
     * invoker should verify that the returned int value is strictly less
     * than the length of {@code tarray}.
     *
     * <p> Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended
     * that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.
     *
     * @param  tarray
     *         an array into which to put the list of threads
     *
     * @return  the number of threads put into the array
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          if {@link java.lang.ThreadGroup#checkAccess} determines that
     *          the current thread cannot access its thread group
