     * Creates a localized version of an input stream. This method takes
     * an <code>InputStream</code> and returns an <code>InputStream</code>
     * equivalent to the argument in all respects except that it is
     * localized: as characters in the local character set are read from
     * the stream, they are automatically converted from the local
     * character set to Unicode.
     * <p>
     * If the argument is already a localized stream, it may be returned
     * as the result.
     *
     * @param      in InputStream to localize
     * @return     a localized input stream
     * @see        java.io.InputStream
     * @see        java.io.BufferedReader#BufferedReader(java.io.Reader)
     * @see        java.io.InputStreamReader#InputStreamReader(java.io.InputStream)
     * @deprecated As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to translate a byte
     * stream in the local encoding into a character stream in Unicode is via
     * the <code>InputStreamReader</code> and <code>BufferedReader</code>
     * classes.
