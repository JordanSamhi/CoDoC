         * Returns a {@link Condition} instance for use with this
         * {@link Lock} instance.
         * <p>The returned {@link Condition} instance supports the same
         * usages as do the {@link Object} monitor methods ({@link
         * Object#wait() wait}, {@link Object#notify notify}, and {@link
         * Object#notifyAll notifyAll}) when used with the built-in
         * monitor lock.
         *
         * <ul>
         *
         * <li>If this write lock is not held when any {@link
         * Condition} method is called then an {@link
         * IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown.  (Read locks are
         * held independently of write locks, so are not checked or
         * affected. However it is essentially always an error to
         * invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread
         * has also acquired read locks, since other threads that
         * could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write
         * lock.)
         *
         * <li>When the condition {@linkplain Condition#await() waiting}
         * methods are called the write lock is released and, before
         * they return, the write lock is reacquired and the lock hold
         * count restored to what it was when the method was called.
         *
         * <li>If a thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while
         * waiting then the wait will terminate, an {@link
         * InterruptedException} will be thrown, and the thread's
         * interrupted status will be cleared.
         *
         * <li>Waiting threads are signalled in FIFO order.
         *
         * <li>The ordering of lock reacquisition for threads returning
         * from waiting methods is the same as for threads initially
         * acquiring the lock, which is in the default case not specified,
         * but for <em>fair</em> locks favors those threads that have been
         * waiting the longest.
         *
         * </ul>
         *
         * @return the Condition object
