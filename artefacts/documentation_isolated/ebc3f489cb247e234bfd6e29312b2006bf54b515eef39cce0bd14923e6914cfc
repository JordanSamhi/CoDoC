     * Gets an unmodifiable list of Strings representing the OBJECT
     * IDENTIFIERs of the {@code ExtKeyUsageSyntax} field of the
     * extended key usage extension, (OID = 2.5.29.37).  It indicates
     * one or more purposes for which the certified public key may be
     * used, in addition to or in place of the basic purposes
     * indicated in the key usage extension field.  The ASN.1
     * definition for this is:

     * Key purposes may be defined by any organization with a
