     * Creates a {@link Spliterator} over the elements described by this
     * {@code Iterable}.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation creates an
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">early-binding</a></em>
     * spliterator from the iterable's {@code Iterator}.  The spliterator
     * inherits the <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the iterable's iterator.
     *
     * @implNote
     * The default implementation should usually be overridden.  The
     * spliterator returned by the default implementation has poor splitting
     * capabilities, is unsized, and does not report any spliterator
     * characteristics. Implementing classes can nearly always provide a
     * better implementation.
