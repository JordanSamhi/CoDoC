     * Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified navigable set.  This method
     * allows modules to provide users with "read-only" access to internal
     * navigable sets.  Query operations on the returned navigable set "read
     * through" to the specified navigable set.  Attempts to modify the returned
     * navigable set, whether direct, via its iterator, or via its
     * {@code subSet}, {@code headSet}, or {@code tailSet} views, result in
     * an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.<p>
     *
     * The returned navigable set will be serializable if the specified
     * navigable set is serializable.
     *
     * @param  <T> the class of the objects in the set
     * @param s the navigable set for which an unmodifiable view is to be
     *        returned
     * @return an unmodifiable view of the specified navigable set
     * @since 1.8
