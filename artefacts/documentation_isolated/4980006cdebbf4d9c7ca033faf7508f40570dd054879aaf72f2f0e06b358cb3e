     * Stream marks are intended to be used in
     * situations where you need to read ahead a little to see what's in
     * the stream. Often this is most easily done by invoking some
     * general parser. If the stream is of the type handled by the
     * parse, it just chugs along happily. If the stream is not of
     * that type, the parser should toss an exception when it fails.
     * If this happens within readlimit bytes, it allows the outer
     * code to reset the stream and try another parser.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  if the stream has not been marked or if the
     *               mark has been invalidated.
