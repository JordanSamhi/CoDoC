     * Removes this task from the executor's internal queue if it is
     * present, thus causing it not to be run if it has not already
     * started.
     *
     * <p>This method may be useful as one part of a cancellation
     * scheme.  It may fail to remove tasks that have been converted
     * into other forms before being placed on the internal queue.
     * For example, a task entered using {@code submit} might be
     * converted into a form that maintains {@code Future} status.
     * However, in such cases, method {@link #purge} may be used to
     * remove those Futures that have been cancelled.
     *
     * @param task the task to remove
     * @return {@code true} if the task was removed
