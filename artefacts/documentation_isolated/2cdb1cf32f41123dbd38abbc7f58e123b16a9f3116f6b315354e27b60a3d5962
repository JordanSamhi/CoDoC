     * so the copy has the specified length.  For all indices that are
     * valid in both the original array and the copy, the two arrays will
     * contain identical values.  For any indices that are valid in the
     * copy but not the original, the copy will contain <tt>(short)0</tt>.
     * Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length
     * is greater than that of the original array.
