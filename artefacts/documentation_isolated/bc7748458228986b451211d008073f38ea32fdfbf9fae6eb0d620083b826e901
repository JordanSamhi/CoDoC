     * Compares this object against the specified object.  The result
     * is {@code true} if and only if the argument is not
     * {@code null} and is a {@code Float} object that
     * represents a {@code float} with the same value as the
     * {@code float} represented by this object. For this
     * purpose, two {@code float} values are considered to be the
     * same if and only if the method {@link #floatToIntBits(float)}
     * returns the identical {@code int} value when applied to
     * each.
     *
     * <p>Note that in most cases, for two instances of class
     * {@code Float}, {@code f1} and {@code f2}, the value
     * of {@code f1.equals(f2)} is {@code true} if and only if
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *   f1.floatValue() == f2.floatValue()
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>also has the value {@code true}. However, there are two exceptions:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If {@code f1} and {@code f2} both represent
     *     {@code Float.NaN}, then the {@code equals} method returns
     *     {@code true}, even though {@code Float.NaN==Float.NaN}
     *     has the value {@code false}.
     * <li>If {@code f1} represents {@code +0.0f} while
     *     {@code f2} represents {@code -0.0f}, or vice
     *     versa, the {@code equal} test has the value
     *     {@code false}, even though {@code 0.0f==-0.0f}
     *     has the value {@code true}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * This definition allows hash tables to operate properly.
     *
     * @param obj the object to be compared
     * @return  {@code true} if the objects are the same;
     *          {@code false} otherwise.
