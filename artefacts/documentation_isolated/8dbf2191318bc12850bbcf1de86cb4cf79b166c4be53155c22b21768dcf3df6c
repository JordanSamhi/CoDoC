     * Returns <tt>true</tt> if the two specified arrays are <i>deeply
     * equal</i> to one another.  Unlike the {@link #equals(Object[],Object[])}
     * method, this method is appropriate for use with nested arrays of
     * arbitrary depth.
     *
     * <p>Two array references are considered deeply equal if both
     * are <tt>null</tt>, or if they refer to arrays that contain the same
     * number of elements and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
     * arrays are deeply equal.
     *
     * <p>Two possibly <tt>null</tt> elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> are
     * deeply equal if any of the following conditions hold:
     * <ul>
     *    <li> <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> are both arrays of object reference
     *         types, and <tt>Arrays.deepEquals(e1, e2) would return true</tt>
     *    <li> <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> are arrays of the same primitive
     *         type, and the appropriate overloading of
     *         <tt>Arrays.equals(e1, e2)</tt> would return true.
     *    <li> <tt>e1 == e2</tt>
     *    <li> <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt> would return true.
     * </ul>
     * Note that this definition permits <tt>null</tt> elements at any depth.
     *
     * <p>If either of the specified arrays contain themselves as elements
     * either directly or indirectly through one or more levels of arrays,
     * the behavior of this method is undefined.
