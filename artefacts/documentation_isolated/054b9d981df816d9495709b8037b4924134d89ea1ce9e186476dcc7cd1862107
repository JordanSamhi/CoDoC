     * Returns a {@link Set} view of the keys contained in this map.
     *
     * <p>The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order.
     * The set's spliterator is
     * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>,
     * <em>fail-fast</em>, and additionally reports {@link Spliterator#SORTED}
     * and {@link Spliterator#ORDERED} with an encounter order that is ascending
     * key order.  The spliterator's comparator (see
     * {@link java.util.Spliterator#getComparator()}) is {@code null} if
     * the tree map's comparator (see {@link #comparator()}) is {@code null}.
     * Otherwise, the spliterator's comparator is the same as or imposes the
     * same total ordering as the tree map's comparator.
     *
     * <p>The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are
     * reflected in the set, and vice-versa.  If the map is modified
     * while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through
     * the iterator's own {@code remove} operation), the results of
     * the iteration are undefined.  The set supports element removal,
     * which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the
     * {@code Iterator.remove}, {@code Set.remove},
     * {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll}, and {@code clear}
     * operations.  It does not support the {@code add} or {@code addAll}
     * operations.
