     * Opens an asynchronous socket channel.
     *
     * <p> The new channel is created by invoking the {@link
     * AsynchronousChannelProvider#openAsynchronousSocketChannel
     * openAsynchronousSocketChannel} method on the {@link
     * AsynchronousChannelProvider} that created the group. If the group parameter
     * is {@code null} then the resulting channel is created by the system-wide
     * default provider, and bound to the <em>default group</em>.
     *
     * @param   group
     *          The group to which the newly constructed channel should be bound,
     *          or {@code null} for the default group
