     * Sets the {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} option to the
     * specified value for this {@code Socket}. The
     * {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} option is
     * used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
     * the underlying network I/O buffers.
     *
     * <p>Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
     * network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
     * help reduce the backlog of incoming data.
     *
     * <p>Because {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} is a hint,
     * applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
     * should call {@link #getReceiveBufferSize()}.
     *
     * <p>The value of {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} is also used
     * to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
     * Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
     * connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
     * this must be requested <B>before</B> the socket is connected to the
     * remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
     * <ol>
     * <li>For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
     * {@link ServerSocket#setReceiveBufferSize(int)} before the ServerSocket
     * is bound to a local address.<p></li>
     * <li>For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
     * connecting the socket to its remote peer.</li></ol>
     * @param size the size to which to set the receive buffer
     * size. This value must be greater than 0.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the value is 0 or is
     * negative.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error
     * in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
