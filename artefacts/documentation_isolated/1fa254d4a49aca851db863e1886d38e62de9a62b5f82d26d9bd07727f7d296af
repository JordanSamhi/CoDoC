     * Constructs a writer that encodes characters using the given encoder and
     * writes the resulting bytes to the given channel.
     *
     * <p> The resulting stream will contain an internal output buffer of at
     * least <tt>minBufferCap</tt> bytes.  The stream's <tt>write</tt> methods
     * will, as needed, flush the buffer by writing bytes to the underlying
     * channel; if the channel is in non-blocking mode when bytes are to be
     * written then an {@link IllegalBlockingModeException} will be thrown.
     * The resulting stream will not otherwise be buffered.  Closing the stream
     * will in turn cause the channel to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel to which bytes will be written
     *
     * @param  enc
     *         The charset encoder to be used
     *
     * @param  minBufferCap
     *         The minimum capacity of the internal byte buffer,
     *         or <tt>-1</tt> if an implementation-dependent
     *         default capacity is to be used
     *
     * @return  A new writer
