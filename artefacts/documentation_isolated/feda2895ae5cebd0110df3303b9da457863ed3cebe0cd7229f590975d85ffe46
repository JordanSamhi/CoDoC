     * Constructs a stream that reads bytes from the given channel.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>read</tt> methods of the resulting stream will throw an
     * {@link IllegalBlockingModeException} if invoked while the underlying
     * channel is in non-blocking mode.  The stream will not be buffered, and
     * it will not support the {@link InputStream#mark mark} or {@link
     * InputStream#reset reset} methods.  The stream will be safe for access by
     * multiple concurrent threads.  Closing the stream will in turn cause the
     * channel to be closed.  </p>
     *
     * @param  ch
     *         The channel from which bytes will be read
     *
     * @return  A new input stream
