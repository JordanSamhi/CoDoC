     * Compares this object against the specified object.  The result
     * is {@code true} if and only if the argument is not
     * {@code null} and is a {@code Double} object that
     * represents a {@code double} that has the same value as the
     * {@code double} represented by this object. For this
     * purpose, two {@code double} values are considered to be
     * the same if and only if the method {@link
     * #doubleToLongBits(double)} returns the identical
     * {@code long} value when applied to each.
     *
     * <p>Note that in most cases, for two instances of class
     * {@code Double}, {@code d1} and {@code d2}, the
     * value of {@code d1.equals(d2)} is {@code true} if and
     * only if
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *  {@code d1.doubleValue() == d2.doubleValue()}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * <p>also has the value {@code true}. However, there are two
     * exceptions:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If {@code d1} and {@code d2} both represent
     *     {@code Double.NaN}, then the {@code equals} method
     *     returns {@code true}, even though
     *     {@code Double.NaN==Double.NaN} has the value
     *     {@code false}.
     * <li>If {@code d1} represents {@code +0.0} while
     *     {@code d2} represents {@code -0.0}, or vice versa,
     *     the {@code equal} test has the value {@code false},
     *     even though {@code +0.0==-0.0} has the value {@code true}.
     * </ul>
     * This definition allows hash tables to operate properly.
     * @param   obj   the object to compare with.
     * @return  {@code true} if the objects are the same;
     *          {@code false} otherwise.
