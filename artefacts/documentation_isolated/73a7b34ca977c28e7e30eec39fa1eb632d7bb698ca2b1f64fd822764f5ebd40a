     * Calculates the amount of time until another year in terms of the specified unit.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code Year}
     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified year.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
     * {@code Year} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * For example, the amount in decades between two year can be calculated
     * using {@code startYear.until(endYear, DECADES)}.
     * <p>
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two years.
     * For example, the amount in decades between 2012 and 2031
     * will only be one decade as it is one year short of two decades.
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   amount = start.until(end, YEARS);
     *   amount = YEARS.between(start, end);
     * </pre>
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * The units {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES}, {@code CENTURIES},
     * {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
     * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
     *
     * @param endExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a {@code Year}, not null
     * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
     * @return the amount of time between this year and the end year
     * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
     *  temporal cannot be converted to a {@code Year}
     * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
