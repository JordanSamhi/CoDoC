     * Return a {@code Stream} that is lazily populated with {@code
     * Path} by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file.  The
     * file tree is traversed <em>depth-first</em>, the elements in the stream
     * are {@link Path} objects that are obtained as if by {@link
     * Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the relative path against {@code start}.
     *
     * <p> The {@code stream} walks the file tree as elements are consumed.
     * The {@code Stream} returned is guaranteed to have at least one
     * element, the starting file itself. For each file visited, the stream
     * attempts to read its {@link BasicFileAttributes}. If the file is a
     * directory and can be opened successfully, entries in the directory, and
     * their <em>descendants</em> will follow the directory in the stream as
     * they are encountered. When all entries have been visited, then the
     * directory is closed. The file tree walk then continues at the next
     * <em>sibling</em> of the directory.
     *
     * <p> The stream is <i>weakly consistent</i>. It does not freeze the
     * file tree while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates to
     * the file tree that occur after returned from this method.
     *
     * <p> By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
     * method. If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link
     * FileVisitOption#FOLLOW_LINKS FOLLOW_LINKS} option then symbolic links are
     * followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
     * be read, then this method attempts to get the {@code BasicFileAttributes}
     * of the link.
     *
     * <p> If the {@code options} parameter contains the {@link
     * FileVisitOption#FOLLOW_LINKS FOLLOW_LINKS} option then the stream keeps
     * track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
     * arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
     * directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the {@link
     * java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes#fileKey file-key} of directories,
     * or if file keys are not available, by invoking the {@link #isSameFile
     * isSameFile} method to test if a directory is the same file as an
     * ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
     * an instance of {@link FileSystemLoopException}.
     *
     * <p> The {@code maxDepth} parameter is the maximum number of levels of
     * directories to visit. A value of {@code 0} means that only the starting
     * file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of
     * {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE MAX_VALUE} may be used to indicate that all
     * levels should be visited.
     *
     * <p> When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
     * (or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream.
     *
     * <p> The returned stream encapsulates one or more {@link DirectoryStream}s.
     * If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the
     * {@code try}-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
     * stream's {@link Stream#close close} method is invoked after the stream
     * operations are completed.  Operating on a closed stream will result in an
     * {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.
     *
     * <p> If an {@link IOException} is thrown when accessing the directory
     * after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an {@link
     * UncheckedIOException} which will be thrown from the method that caused
     * the access to take place.
