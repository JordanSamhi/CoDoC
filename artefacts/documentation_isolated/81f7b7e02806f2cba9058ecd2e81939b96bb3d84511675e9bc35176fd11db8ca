     * Mark the start of an optional section.
     * <p>
     * The output of formatting can include optional sections, which may be nested.
     * An optional section is started by calling this method and ended by calling
     * {@link #optionalEnd()} or by ending the build process.
     * <p>
     * All elements in the optional section are treated as optional.
     * During formatting, the section is only output if data is available in the
     * {@code TemporalAccessor} for all the elements in the section.
     * During parsing, the whole section may be missing from the parsed string.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a builder setup as
     * {@code builder.appendValue(HOUR_OF_DAY,2).optionalStart().appendValue(MINUTE_OF_HOUR,2)}.
     * The optional section ends automatically at the end of the builder.
     * During formatting, the minute will only be output if its value can be obtained from the date-time.
     * During parsing, the input will be successfully parsed whether the minute is present or not.
     *
     * @return this, for chaining, not null
