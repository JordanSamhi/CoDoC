     * Obtains an instance of {@code LocalDateTime} from an {@code Instant} and zone ID.
     * <p>
     * This creates a local date-time based on the specified instant.
     * First, the offset from UTC/Greenwich is obtained using the zone ID and instant,
     * which is simple as there is only one valid offset for each instant.
     * Then, the instant and offset are used to calculate the local date-time.
     *
     * @param instant  the instant to create the date-time from, not null
     * @param zone  the time-zone, which may be an offset, not null
     * @return the local date-time, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported range
