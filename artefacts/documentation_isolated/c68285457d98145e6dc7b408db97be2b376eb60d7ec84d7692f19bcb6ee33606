     * Sets a default proposed value for the
     * {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} option for sockets
     * accepted from this {@code ServerSocket}. The value actually set
     * in the accepted socket must be determined by calling
     * {@link Socket#getReceiveBufferSize()} after the socket
     * is returned by {@link #accept()}.
     * <p>
     * The value of {@link SocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} is used both to
     * set the size of the internal socket receive buffer, and to set the size
     * of the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
     * <p>
     * It is possible to change the value subsequently, by calling
     * {@link Socket#setReceiveBufferSize(int)}. However, if the application
     * wishes to allow a receive window larger than 64K bytes, as defined by RFC1323
     * then the proposed value must be set in the ServerSocket <B>before</B>
     * it is bound to a local address. This implies, that the ServerSocket must be
     * created with the no-argument constructor, then setReceiveBufferSize() must
     * be called and lastly the ServerSocket is bound to an address by calling bind().
     * <p>
     * Failure to do this will not cause an error, and the buffer size may be set to the
     * requested value but the TCP receive window in sockets accepted from
     * this ServerSocket will be no larger than 64K bytes.
     *
     * @exception SocketException if there is an error
     * in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
     *
     * @param size the size to which to set the receive buffer
     * size. This value must be greater than 0.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the
     * value is 0 or is negative.
