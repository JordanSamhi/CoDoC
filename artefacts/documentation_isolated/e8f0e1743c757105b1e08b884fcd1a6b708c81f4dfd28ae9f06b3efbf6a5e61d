     * Returns the unique {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel FileChannel}
     * object associated with this file.

     * <p> The {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel#position()
     * position} of the returned channel will always be equal to
     * this object's file-pointer offset as returned by the {@link
     * #getFilePointer getFilePointer} method.  Changing this object's
     * file-pointer offset, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes,
     * will change the position of the channel, and vice versa.  Changing the
     * file's length via this object will change the length seen via the file
     * channel, and vice versa.
