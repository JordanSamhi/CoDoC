     * Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
     * subsequent {@code fork}. This method allows repeated reuse of
     * this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
     * never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
     * outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
     * under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
     * This method may be useful when executing
     * pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.
     *
     * <p>Upon completion of this method, {@code isDone()} reports
     * {@code false}, and {@code getException()} reports {@code
     * null}. However, the value returned by {@code getRawResult} is
     * unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke {@code
     * setRawResult(null)}.
