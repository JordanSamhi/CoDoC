     * Returns an object of the same type as this object with an amount added.
     * <p>
     * This adjusts this temporal, adding according to the rules of the specified amount.
     * The amount is typically a {@link java.time.Period} but may be any other type implementing
     * the {@link TemporalAmount} interface, such as {@link java.time.Duration}.
     * <p>
     * Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
     * <pre>
     *  date = date.plus(period);                // add a Period instance
     *  date = date.plus(duration);              // add a Duration instance
     *  date = date.plus(workingDays(6));        // example user-written workingDays method
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Note that calling {@code plus} followed by {@code minus} is not guaranteed to
     * return the same date-time.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * <p>
     * Implementations must not alter either this object or the specified temporal object.
     * Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
     * This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:
     * <pre>
     *  return amount.addTo(this);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param amount  the amount to add, not null
     * @return an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
