     * Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string
     * constants in this tokenizer.
     * <p>
     * When the {@code nextToken} method encounters a string
     * constant, the {@code ttype} field is set to the string
     * delimiter and the {@code sval} field is set to the body of
     * the string.
     * <p>
     * If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
     * recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
     * the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
     * occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
     * terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as
     * {@code "\u005Cn"} and {@code "\u005Ct"} are recognized and
     * converted to single characters as the string is parsed.
     *
     * <p>Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.
