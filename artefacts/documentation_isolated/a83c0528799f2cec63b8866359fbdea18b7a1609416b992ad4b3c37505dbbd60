     * Obtains an instance of {@code Chronology} from a chronology ID or
     * calendar system type.
     * <p>
     * This returns a chronology based on either the ID or the type.
     * The {@link #getId() chronology ID} uniquely identifies the chronology.
     * The {@link #getCalendarType() calendar system type} is defined by the
     * CLDR specification.
     * <p>
     * The chronology may be a system chronology or a chronology
     * provided by the application via ServiceLoader configuration.
     * <p>
     * Since some calendars can be customized, the ID or type typically refers
     * to the default customization. For example, the Gregorian calendar can have multiple
     * cutover dates from the Julian, but the lookup only provides the default cutover date.
     *
     * @param id  the chronology ID or calendar system type, not null
     * @return the chronology with the identifier requested, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the chronology cannot be found
