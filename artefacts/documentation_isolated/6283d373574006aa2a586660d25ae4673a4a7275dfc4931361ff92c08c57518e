     * Returns the system-wide default asynchronous channel provider for this
     * invocation of the Java virtual machine.
     *
     * <p> The first invocation of this method locates the default provider
     * object as follows: </p>
     *
     * <ol>
     *
     *   <li><p> If the system property
     *   <tt>java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider</tt> is defined
     *   then it is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete provider class.
     *   The class is loaded and instantiated; if this process fails then an
     *   unspecified error is thrown.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> If a provider class has been installed in a jar file that is
     *   visible to the system class loader, and that jar file contains a
     *   provider-configuration file named
     *   <tt>java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider</tt> in the resource
     *   directory <tt>META-INF/services</tt>, then the first class name
     *   specified in that file is taken.  The class is loaded and
     *   instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is
     *   thrown.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> Finally, if no provider has been specified by any of the above
     *   means then the system-default provider class is instantiated and the
     *   result is returned.  </p></li>
     *
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p> Subsequent invocations of this method return the provider that was
     * returned by the first invocation.  </p>
     *
     * @return  The system-wide default AsynchronousChannel provider
