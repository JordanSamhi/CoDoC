     * Obtains a clock that returns instants from the specified clock truncated
     * to the nearest occurrence of the specified duration.
     * <p>
     * This clock will only tick as per the specified duration. Thus, if the duration
     * is half a second, the clock will return instants truncated to the half second.
     * <p>
     * The tick duration must be positive. If it has a part smaller than a whole
     * millisecond, then the whole duration must divide into one second without
     * leaving a remainder. All normal tick durations will match these criteria,
     * including any multiple of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, and
     * sensible nanosecond durations, such as 20ns, 250,000ns and 500,000ns.
     * <p>
     * A duration of zero or one nanosecond would have no truncation effect.
     * Passing one of these will return the underlying clock.
     * <p>
     * Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
     * As such, it is possible that the start of the requested duration observed
     * via this clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.
     * <p>
     * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}
     * providing that the base clock is.
     *
     * @param baseClock  the base clock to base the ticking clock on, not null
     * @param tickDuration  the duration of each visible tick, not negative, not null
     * @return a clock that ticks in whole units of the duration, not null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the duration is negative, or has a
     *  part smaller than a whole millisecond such that the whole duration is not
     *  divisible into one second
     * @throws ArithmeticException if the duration is too large to be represented as nanos
