     * Returns true if this executor is in the process of terminating
     * after {@link #shutdown} or {@link #shutdownNow} but has not
     * completely terminated.  This method may be useful for
     * debugging. A return of {@code true} reported a sufficient
     * period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have
     * ignored or suppressed interruption, causing this executor not
     * to properly terminate.

     * @return {@code true} if terminating but not yet terminated
