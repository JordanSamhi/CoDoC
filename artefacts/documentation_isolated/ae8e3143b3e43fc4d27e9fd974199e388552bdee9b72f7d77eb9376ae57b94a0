     * Returns a lexicographic-order comparator with a function that
     * extracts a {@code double} sort key.
     *
     * @implSpec This default implementation behaves as if {@code
     *           thenComparing(comparingDouble(keyExtractor))}.
     *
     * @param  keyExtractor the function used to extract the double sort key
     * @return a lexicographic-order comparator composed of this and then the
     *         {@code double} sort key
     * @throws NullPointerException if the argument is null.
