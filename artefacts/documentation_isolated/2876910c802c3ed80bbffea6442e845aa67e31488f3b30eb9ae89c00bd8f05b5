     * Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
     * given condition associated with this lock. Note that because
     * timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the estimate
     * serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of waiters.
     * This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system
     * state, not for synchronization control.
