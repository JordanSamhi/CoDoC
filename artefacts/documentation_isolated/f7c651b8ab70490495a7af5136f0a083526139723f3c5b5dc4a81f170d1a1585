     * Returns the starting position of the first occurrence of the specified
     * target list within the specified source list, or -1 if there is no
     * such occurrence.  More formally, returns the lowest index <tt>i</tt>
     * such that {@code source.subList(i, i+target.size()).equals(target)},
     * or -1 if there is no such index.  (Returns -1 if
     * {@code target.size() > source.size()})
     *
     * <p>This implementation uses the "brute force" technique of scanning
     * over the source list, looking for a match with the target at each
     * location in turn.
     *
     * @param source the list in which to search for the first occurrence
     *        of <tt>target</tt>.
     * @param target the list to search for as a subList of <tt>source</tt>.
     * @return the starting position of the first occurrence of the specified
     *         target list within the specified source list, or -1 if there
     *         is no such occurrence.
