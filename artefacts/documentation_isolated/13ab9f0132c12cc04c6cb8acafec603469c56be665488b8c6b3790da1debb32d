     * Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.
     *
     * <p>Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
     * one.  If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
     * selected and given the permit that was just released.  That thread
     * is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.
     *
     * <p>There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
     * have acquired that permit by calling {@link #acquire}.
     * Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
     * in the application.
