     * <p>
     * Note: Closing a socket doesn't clear its connection state, which means
     * this method will return {@code true} for a closed socket
     * (see {@link #isClosed()}) if it was successfuly connected prior
     * to being closed.
     *
     * @return true if the socket was successfuly connected to a server
