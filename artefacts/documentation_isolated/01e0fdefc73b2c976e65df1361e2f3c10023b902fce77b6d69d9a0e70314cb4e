     * Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
     * acquire.  Because the actual set of threads may change
     * dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
     * collection is only a best-effort estimate.  The elements of the
     * returned collection are in no particular order.  This method is
     * designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide
     * more extensive monitoring facilities.
