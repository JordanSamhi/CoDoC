     * Compares this date to another date.
     * <p>
     * The comparison is primarily based on the date, from earliest to latest.
     * It is "consistent with equals", as defined by {@link Comparable}.
     * <p>
     * If all the dates being compared are instances of {@code LocalDate},
     * then the comparison will be entirely based on the date.
     * If some dates being compared are in different chronologies, then the
     * chronology is also considered, see {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate#compareTo}.
     *
     * @param other  the other date to compare to, not null
     * @return the comparator value, negative if less, positive if greater
