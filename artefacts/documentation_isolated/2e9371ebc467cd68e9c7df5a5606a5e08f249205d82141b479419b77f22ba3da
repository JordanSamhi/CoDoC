     * Gets a specified property for an algorithm. The algorithm name
     * should be a standard name. See the <a href=
     * "{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html">
     * Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation</a>
     * for information about standard algorithm names.
     *
     * One possible use is by specialized algorithm parsers, which may map
     * classes to algorithms which they understand (much like Key parsers
     * do).
     *
     * @param algName the algorithm name.
     *
     * @param propName the name of the property to get.
     *
     * @return the value of the specified property.
     *
     * @deprecated This method used to return the value of a proprietary
     * property in the master file of the "SUN" Cryptographic Service
     * Provider in order to determine how to parse algorithm-specific
     * parameters. Use the new provider-based and algorithm-independent
     * {@code AlgorithmParameters} and {@code KeyFactory} engine
     * classes (introduced in the J2SE version 1.2 platform) instead.
