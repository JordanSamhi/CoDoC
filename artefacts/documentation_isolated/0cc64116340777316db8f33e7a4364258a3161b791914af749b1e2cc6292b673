     * Opens or creates a file for writing, returning a {@code BufferedWriter}
     * that may be used to write text to the file in an efficient manner.
     * The {@code options} parameter specifies how the the file is created or
     * opened. If no options are present then this method works as if the {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#CREATE CREATE}, {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING}, and {@link
     * StandardOpenOption#WRITE WRITE} options are present. In other words, it
     * opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't exist, or
     * initially truncating an existing {@link #isRegularFile regular-file} to
     * a size of {@code 0} if it exists.
     *
     * <p> The {@code Writer} methods to write text throw {@code IOException}
     * if the text cannot be encoded using the specified charset.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   cs
     *          the charset to use for encoding
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new buffered writer, with default buffer size, to write text
     *          to the file
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs opening or creating the file
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported option is specified
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
     *          method is invoked to check write access to the file.
