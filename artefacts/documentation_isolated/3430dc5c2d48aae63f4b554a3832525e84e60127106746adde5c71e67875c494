     * English locale, with grouping on, the number 1234567 might be formatted
     * as "1,234,567". The grouping separator as well as the size of each group
     * is locale dependant and is determined by sub-classes of NumberFormat.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if grouping is used;
     *         {@code false} otherwise
     * @see #setGroupingUsed
