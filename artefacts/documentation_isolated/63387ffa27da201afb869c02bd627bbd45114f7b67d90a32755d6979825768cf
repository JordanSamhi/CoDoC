     * Opens a socket channel and connects it to a remote address.
     *
     * <p> This convenience method works as if by invoking the {@link #open()}
     * method, invoking the {@link #connect(SocketAddress) connect} method upon
     * the resulting socket channel, passing it <tt>remote</tt>, and then
     * returning that channel.  </p>
     *
     * @param  remote
     *         The remote address to which the new channel is to be connected
     *
     * @return  A new, and connected, socket channel
     *
     * @throws  AsynchronousCloseException
     *          If another thread closes this channel
     *          while the connect operation is in progress
     *
     * @throws  ClosedByInterruptException
     *          If another thread interrupts the current thread
     *          while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
     *          closing the channel and setting the current thread's
     *          interrupt status
     *
     * @throws  UnresolvedAddressException
     *          If the given remote address is not fully resolved
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedAddressTypeException
     *          If the type of the given remote address is not supported
     *
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If a security manager has been installed
     *          and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If some other I/O error occurs
