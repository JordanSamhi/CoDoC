     * Completes this task abnormally, and if not already aborted or
     * cancelled, causes it to throw the given exception upon
     * {@code join} and related operations. This method may be used
     * to induce exceptions in asynchronous tasks, or to force
     * completion of tasks that would not otherwise complete.  Its use
     * in other situations is discouraged.  This method is
     * overridable, but overridden versions must invoke {@code super}
     * implementation to maintain guarantees.

     * @param ex the exception to throw. If this exception is not a
     * {@code RuntimeException} or {@code Error}, the actual exception
     * thrown will be a {@code RuntimeException} with cause {@code ex}.
