     * Returns the hash code value for this set.  The hash code of a set is
     * defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
     * where the hash code of a <tt>null</tt> element is defined to be zero.
     * This ensures that <tt>s1.equals(s2)</tt> implies that
     * <tt>s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()</tt> for any two sets <tt>s1</tt>
     * and <tt>s2</tt>, as required by the general contract of
     * {@link Object#hashCode}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation iterates over the set, calling the
     * <tt>hashCode</tt> method on each element in the set, and adding up
     * the results.
