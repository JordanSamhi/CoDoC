     * Does this transition represent an overlap in the local time-line.
     * <p>
     * Overlaps occur where there are local date-times that exist twice.
     * An example would be when the offset changes from {@code +02:00} to {@code +01:00}.
     * This might be described as 'the clocks will move back one hour tonight at 2am'.
     *
     * @return true if this transition is an overlap, false if it is a gap
