     * Returns a string representation of the "deep contents" of the specified
     * array.  If the array contains other arrays as elements, the string
     * representation contains their contents and so on.  This method is
     * designed for converting multidimensional arrays to strings.
     *
     * <p>The string representation consists of a list of the array's
     * elements, enclosed in square brackets (<tt>"[]"</tt>).  Adjacent
     * elements are separated by the characters <tt>", "</tt> (a comma
     * followed by a space).  Elements are converted to strings as by
     * <tt>String.valueOf(Object)</tt>, unless they are themselves
     * arrays.
     *
     * <p>If an element <tt>e</tt> is an array of a primitive type, it is
     * converted to a string as by invoking the appropriate overloading of
     * <tt>Arrays.toString(e)</tt>.  If an element <tt>e</tt> is an array of a
     * reference type, it is converted to a string as by invoking
     * this method recursively.
     *
     * <p>To avoid infinite recursion, if the specified array contains itself
     * as an element, or contains an indirect reference to itself through one
     * or more levels of arrays, the self-reference is converted to the string
     * <tt>"[...]"</tt>.  For example, an array containing only a reference
     * to itself would be rendered as <tt>"[[...]]"</tt>.
     *
     * <p>This method returns <tt>"null"</tt> if the specified array
     * is <tt>null</tt>.
