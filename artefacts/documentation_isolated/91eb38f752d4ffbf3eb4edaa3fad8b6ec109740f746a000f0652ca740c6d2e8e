     * Removes the first (lowest-indexed) occurrence of the argument
     * from this vector. If the object is found in this vector, each
     * component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the
     * object's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller
     * than the value it had previously.
     *
     * <p>This method is identical in functionality to the
     * {@link #remove(Object)} method (which is part of the
     * {@link List} interface).
     *
     * @param   obj   the component to be removed
     * @return  {@code true} if the argument was a component of this
     *          vector; {@code false} otherwise.
