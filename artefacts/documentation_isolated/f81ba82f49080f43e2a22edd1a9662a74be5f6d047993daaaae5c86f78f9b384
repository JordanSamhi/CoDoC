     * Finds a resource with a given name.  The rules for searching resources
     * associated with a given class are implemented by the defining
     * {@linkplain ClassLoader class loader} of the class.  This method
     * delegates to this object's class loader.  If this object was loaded by
     * the bootstrap class loader, the method delegates to {@link
     * ClassLoader#getSystemResourceAsStream}.
     *
     * <p> Before delegation, an absolute resource name is constructed from the
     * given resource name using this algorithm:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li> If the {@code name} begins with a {@code '/'}
     * (<tt>'&#92;u002f'</tt>), then the absolute name of the resource is the
     * portion of the {@code name} following the {@code '/'}.
     *
     * <li> Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form:
     *
     * <blockquote>
     *   {@code modified_package_name/name}
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * <p> Where the {@code modified_package_name} is the package name of this
     * object with {@code '/'} substituted for {@code '.'}
     * (<tt>'&#92;u002e'</tt>).
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param  name name of the desired resource
     * @return      A {@link java.io.InputStream} object or {@code null} if
     *              no resource with this name is found
     * @throws  NullPointerException If {@code name} is {@code null}
