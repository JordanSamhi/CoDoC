     * Reads a {@code float} from this file. This method reads an
     * {@code int} value, starting at the current file pointer,
     * as if by the {@code readInt} method
     * and then converts that {@code int} to a {@code float}
     * using the {@code intBitsToFloat} method in class
     * {@code Float}.
     * <p>
     * This method blocks until the four bytes are read, the end of the
     * stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
     *
     * @return     the next four bytes of this file, interpreted as a
     *             {@code float}.
     * @exception  EOFException  if this file reaches the end before reading
     *             four bytes.
     * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
