     *
     * <p> This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
     * by the {@link #newByteChannel(Path,Set,FileAttribute[]) newByteChannel}
     * method.
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file to open or create
     * @param   options
     *          options specifying how the file is opened
     *
     * @return  a new seekable byte channel
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the set contains an invalid combination of options
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if an unsupported open option is specified
     * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
     *          if a file of that name already exists and the {@link
     *          StandardOpenOption#CREATE_NEW CREATE_NEW} option is specified
     *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the path if the file is
     *          opened for reading. The {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)
     *          checkWrite} method is invoked to check write access to the path
     *          if the file is opened for writing. The {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete} method is
     *          invoked to check delete access if the file is opened with the
     *          {@code DELETE_ON_CLOSE} option.
