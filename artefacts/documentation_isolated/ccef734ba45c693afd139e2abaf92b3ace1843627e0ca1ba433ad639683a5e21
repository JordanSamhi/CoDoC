     * Add a log Handler to receive logging messages.
     * <p>
     * By default, Loggers also send their output to their parent logger.
     * Typically the root Logger is configured with a set of Handlers
     * that essentially act as default handlers for all loggers.
     *
     * @param   handler a logging Handler
     * @throws  SecurityException if a security manager exists,
     *          this logger is not anonymous, and the caller
     *          does not have LoggingPermission("control").
