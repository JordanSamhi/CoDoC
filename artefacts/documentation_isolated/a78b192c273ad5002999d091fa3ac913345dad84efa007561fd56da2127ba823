     * Creates a <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>
     * and <em>fail-fast</em> {@link Spliterator} over the elements in this
     * set.
     *
     * <p>The {@code Spliterator} reports {@link Spliterator#SIZED},
     * {@link Spliterator#DISTINCT}, {@link Spliterator#SORTED}, and
     * {@link Spliterator#ORDERED}.  Overriding implementations should document
     * the reporting of additional characteristic values.
     *
     * <p>The spliterator's comparator (see
     * {@link java.util.Spliterator#getComparator()}) is {@code null} if
     * the tree set's comparator (see {@link #comparator()}) is {@code null}.
     * Otherwise, the spliterator's comparator is the same as or imposes the
     * same total ordering as the tree set's comparator.
