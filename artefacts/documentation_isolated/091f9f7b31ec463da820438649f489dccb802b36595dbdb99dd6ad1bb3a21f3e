     * Returns a {@code Collector} that produces the arithmetic mean of a double-valued
     * function applied to the input elements.  If no elements are present,
     * the result is 0.
     *
     * <p>The average returned can vary depending upon the order in which
     * values are recorded, due to accumulated rounding error in
     * addition of values of differing magnitudes. Values sorted by increasing
     * absolute magnitude tend to yield more accurate results.  If any recorded
     * value is a {@code NaN} or the sum is at any point a {@code NaN} then the
     * average will be {@code NaN}.
     *
     * @implNote The {@code double} format can represent all
     * consecutive integers in the range -2<sup>53</sup> to
     * 2<sup>53</sup>. If the pipeline has more than 2<sup>53</sup>
     * values, the divisor in the average computation will saturate at
     * 2<sup>53</sup>, leading to additional numerical errors.
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the input elements
     * @param mapper a function extracting the property to be summed
     * @return a {@code Collector} that produces the sum of a derived property
