     * Reads the value of a file attribute.
     *
     * <p> The {@code attribute} parameter identifies the attribute to be read
     * and takes the form:
     * <blockquote>
     * [<i>view-name</i><b>:</b>]<i>attribute-name</i>
     * </blockquote>
     * where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
     * character {@code ':'} stands for itself.
     *
     * <p> <i>view-name</i> is the {@link FileAttributeView#name name} of a {@link
     * FileAttributeView} that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
     * specified then it defaults to {@code "basic"}, the name of the file
     * attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
     * many file systems. <i>attribute-name</i> is the name of the attribute.
     *
     * <p> The {@code options} array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
     * are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
     * symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
     * of the link is read. If the option {@link LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS
     * NOFOLLOW_LINKS} is present then symbolic links are not followed.
     *
     * <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
     * Suppose we require the user ID of the file owner on a system that
     * supports a "{@code unix}" view:
     * <pre>
     *    Path path = ...
     *    int uid = (Integer)Files.getAttribute(path, "unix:uid");
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     * @param   attribute
     *          the attribute to read
     * @param   options
     *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
     *
     * @return  the attribute value
     *
     * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
     *          if the attribute view is not available
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the attribute name is not specified or is not recognized
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, its {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method denies read access to the file. If this method is invoked
     *          to read security sensitive attributes then the security manager
     *          may be invoked to check for additional permissions.
