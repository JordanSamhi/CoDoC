     * Get all the packages currently known for the caller's {@code ClassLoader}
     * instance.  Those packages correspond to classes loaded via or accessible by
     * name to that {@code ClassLoader} instance.  If the caller's
     * {@code ClassLoader} instance is the bootstrap {@code ClassLoader}
     * instance, which may be represented by {@code null} in some implementations,
     * only packages corresponding to classes loaded by the bootstrap
     * {@code ClassLoader} instance will be returned.
     *
     * @return a new array of packages known to the callers {@code ClassLoader}
     * instance.  An zero length array is returned if none are known.
