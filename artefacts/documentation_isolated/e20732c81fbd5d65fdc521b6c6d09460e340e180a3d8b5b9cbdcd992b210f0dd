     * Returns the assertion status that would be assigned to this
     * class if it were to be initialized at the time this method is invoked.
     * If this class has had its assertion status set, the most recent
     * setting will be returned; otherwise, if any package default assertion
     * status pertains to this class, the most recent setting for the most
     * specific pertinent package default assertion status is returned;
     * otherwise, if this class is not a system class (i.e., it has a
     * class loader) its class loader's default assertion status is returned;
     * otherwise, the system class default assertion status is returned.
     * <p>
     * Few programmers will have any need for this method; it is provided
     * for the benefit of the JRE itself.  (It allows a class to determine at
     * the time that it is initialized whether assertions should be enabled.)
     * Note that this method is not guaranteed to return the actual
     * assertion status that was (or will be) associated with the specified
     * class when it was (or will be) initialized.
     *
     * @return the desired assertion status of the specified class.
