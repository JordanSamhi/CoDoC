     * Returns {@code true} if the process of termination has
     * commenced but not yet completed.  This method may be useful for
     * debugging. A return of {@code true} reported a sufficient
     * period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have
     * ignored or suppressed interruption, or are waiting for I/O,
     * causing this executor not to properly terminate. (See the
     * advisory notes for class {@link ForkJoinTask} stating that
     * tasks should not normally entail blocking operations.  But if
     * they do, they must abort them on interrupt.)
