     * Tells whether or not this charset supports encoding.
     *
     * <p> Nearly all charsets support encoding.  The primary exceptions are
     * special-purpose <i>auto-detect</i> charsets whose decoders can determine
     * which of several possible encoding schemes is in use by examining the
     * input byte sequence.  Such charsets do not support encoding because
     * there is no way to determine which encoding should be used on output.
     * Implementations of such charsets should override this method to return
     * <tt>false</tt>. </p>
     *
     * @return  <tt>true</tt> if, and only if, this charset supports encoding
