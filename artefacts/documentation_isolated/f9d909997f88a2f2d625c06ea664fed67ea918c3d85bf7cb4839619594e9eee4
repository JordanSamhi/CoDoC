     * Returns a copy of this formatter with a new resolver style.
     * <p>
     * This returns a formatter with similar state to this formatter but
     * with the resolver style set. By default, a formatter has the
     * {@link ResolverStyle#SMART SMART} resolver style.
     * <p>
     * Changing the resolver style only has an effect during parsing.
     * Parsing a text string occurs in two phases.
     * Phase 1 is a basic text parse according to the fields added to the builder.
     * Phase 2 resolves the parsed field-value pairs into date and/or time objects.
     * The resolver style is used to control how phase 2, resolving, happens.
     * See {@code ResolverStyle} for more information on the options available.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

     * @param resolverStyle  the new resolver style, not null
     * @return a formatter based on this formatter with the requested resolver style, not null
