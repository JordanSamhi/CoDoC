     * Creates a thread pool that maintains enough threads to support
     * the given parallelism level, and may use multiple queues to
     * reduce contention. The parallelism level corresponds to the
     * maximum number of threads actively engaged in, or available to
     * engage in, task processing. The actual number of threads may
     * grow and shrink dynamically. A work-stealing pool makes no
     * guarantees about the order in which submitted tasks are
     * executed.
     *
     * @param parallelism the targeted parallelism level
     * @return the newly created thread pool
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code parallelism <= 0}
