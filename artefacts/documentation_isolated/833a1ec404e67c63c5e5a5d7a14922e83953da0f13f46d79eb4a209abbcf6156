     * Obtains an instance of {@code Chronology} from a locale.
     * <p>
     * This returns a {@code Chronology} based on the specified locale,
     * typically returning {@code IsoChronology}. Other calendar systems
     * are only returned if they are explicitly selected within the locale.
     * <p>
     * The {@link Locale} class provide access to a range of information useful
     * for localizing an application. This includes the language and region,
     * such as "en-GB" for English as used in Great Britain.
     * <p>
     * The {@code Locale} class also supports an extension mechanism that
     * can be used to identify a calendar system. The mechanism is a form
     * of key-value pairs, where the calendar system has the key "ca".
     * For example, the locale "en-JP-u-ca-japanese" represents the English
     * language as used in Japan with the Japanese calendar system.
     * <p>
     * This method finds the desired calendar system by in a manner equivalent
     * to passing "ca" to {@link Locale#getUnicodeLocaleType(String)}.
     * If the "ca" key is not present, then {@code IsoChronology} is returned.
     * <p>
     * Note that the behavior of this method differs from the older
     * {@link java.util.Calendar#getInstance(Locale)} method.
     * If that method receives a locale of "th_TH" it will return {@code BuddhistCalendar}.
     * By contrast, this method will return {@code IsoChronology}.
     * Passing the locale "th-TH-u-ca-buddhist" into either method will
     * result in the Thai Buddhist calendar system and is therefore the
     * recommended approach going forward for Thai calendar system localization.
     * <p>
     * A similar, but simpler, situation occurs for the Japanese calendar system.
     * The locale "jp_JP_JP" has previously been used to access the calendar.
     * However, unlike the Thai locale, "ja_JP_JP" is automatically converted by
     * {@code Locale} to the modern and recommended form of "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese".
     * Thus, there is no difference in behavior between this method and
     * {@code Calendar#getInstance(Locale)}.
     *
     * @param locale  the locale to use to obtain the calendar system, not null
     * @return the calendar system associated with the locale, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException if the locale-specified calendar cannot be found
