     * Returns the code point preceding the given index of the
     * {@code char} array. If the {@code char} value at
     * {@code (index - 1)} in the {@code char} array is in
     * the low-surrogate range, {@code (index - 2)} is not
     * negative, and the {@code char} value at {@code (index - 2)}
     * in the {@code char} array is in the
     * high-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point
     * corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise,
     * the {@code char} value at {@code (index - 1)} is
     * returned.
     *
     * @param a the {@code char} array
     * @param index the index following the code point that should be returned
     * @return the Unicode code point value before the given index.
     * @exception NullPointerException if {@code a} is null.
     * @exception IndexOutOfBoundsException if the {@code index}
     * argument is less than 1 or greater than the length of the
     * {@code char} array
