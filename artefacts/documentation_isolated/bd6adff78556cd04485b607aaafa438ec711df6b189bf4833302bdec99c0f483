     * Read all lines from a file. Bytes from the file are decoded into characters
     * using the {@link StandardCharsets#UTF_8 UTF-8} {@link Charset charset}.
     *
     * <p> This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
     * expression:
     * <pre>{@code
     * Files.readAllLines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param   path
     *          the path to the file
     *
     * @return  the lines from the file as a {@code List}; whether the {@code
     *          List} is modifiable or not is implementation dependent and
     *          therefore not specified
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error occurs reading from the file or a malformed or
     *          unmappable byte sequence is read
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
     *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
     *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
