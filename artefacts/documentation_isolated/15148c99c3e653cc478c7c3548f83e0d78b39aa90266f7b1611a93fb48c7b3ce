     * Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this day-of-week.
     * <p>
     * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
     * with the day-of-week changed to be the same as this.
     * <p>
     * The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
     * passing {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} as the field.
     * Note that this adjusts forwards or backwards within a Monday to Sunday week.
     * See {@link java.time.temporal.WeekFields#dayOfWeek()} for localized week start days.
     * See {@code TemporalAdjuster} for other adjusters with more control,
     * such as {@code next(MONDAY)}.
     * <p>
     * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
     * {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
     *   temporal = thisDayOfWeek.adjustInto(temporal);
     *   temporal = temporal.with(thisDayOfWeek);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * For example, given a date that is a Wednesday, the following are output:
     * <pre>
     *   dateOnWed.with(MONDAY);     // two days earlier
     *   dateOnWed.with(TUESDAY);    // one day earlier
     *   dateOnWed.with(WEDNESDAY);  // same date
     *   dateOnWed.with(THURSDAY);   // one day later
     *   dateOnWed.with(FRIDAY);     // two days later
     *   dateOnWed.with(SATURDAY);   // three days later
     *   dateOnWed.with(SUNDAY);     // four days later
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
