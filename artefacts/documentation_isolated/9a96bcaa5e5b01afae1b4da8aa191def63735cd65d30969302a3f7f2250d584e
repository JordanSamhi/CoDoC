     * Returns a field to access the week of year based on this {@code WeekFields}.
     * <p>
     * This represents the concept of the count of weeks within the year where weeks
     * start on a fixed day-of-week, such as Monday.
     * This field is typically used with {@link WeekFields#dayOfWeek()}.
     * <p>
     * Week one(1) is the week starting on the {@link WeekFields#getFirstDayOfWeek}
     * where there are at least {@link WeekFields#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()} days in the year.
     * Thus, week one may start up to {@code minDays} days before the start of the year.
     * If the first week starts after the start of the year then the period before is week zero (0).
     * <p>
     * For example:<br>
     * - if the 1st day of the year is a Monday, week one starts on the 1st and there is no week zero<br>
     * - if the 2nd day of the year is a Monday, week one starts on the 2nd and the 1st is in week zero<br>
     * - if the 4th day of the year is a Monday, week one starts on the 4th and the 1st to 3rd is in week zero<br>
     * - if the 5th day of the year is a Monday, week two starts on the 5th and the 1st to 4th is in week one<br>
     * <p>
     * This field can be used with any calendar system.
     * <p>
     * In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
     * week-of-year and day-of-week.
     * <p>
     * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode}, all three fields are
     * validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-year field
     * is validated to ensure that the resulting year is the year requested.
     * <p>
     * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}, all three fields are
     * validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-year field
     * is validated from 0 to 54, meaning that the resulting date can be in a
     * different year to that specified.
     * <p>
     * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode}, the year and day-of-week
     * are validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated
     * equivalent to the following three stage approach.
     * First, create a date on the first day of the first week in the requested year.
     * Then take the week-of-year, subtract one, and add the amount in weeks to the date.
     * Finally, adjust to the correct day-of-week within the localized week.
     *
     * @return a field providing access to the week-of-year, not null
