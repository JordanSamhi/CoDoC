     * Creates an asynchronous channel group with a given thread pool that
     * creates new threads as needed.
     *
     * <p> The {@code executor} parameter is an {@code ExecutorService} that
     * creates new threads as needed to execute tasks that are submitted to
     * handle I/O events and dispatch completion results for operations initiated
     * on asynchronous channels in the group. It may reuse previously constructed
     * threads when they are available.
     *
     * <p> The {@code initialSize} parameter may be used by the implementation
     * as a <em>hint</em> as to the initial number of tasks it may submit. For
     * example, it may be used to indicate the initial number of threads that
     * wait on I/O events.
     *
     * <p> The executor is intended to be used exclusively by the resulting
     * asynchronous channel group. Termination of the group results in the
     * orderly  {@link ExecutorService#shutdown shutdown} of the executor
     * service. Shutting down the executor service by other means results in
     * unspecified behavior.
     *
     * <p> The group is created by invoking the {@link
     * AsynchronousChannelProvider#openAsynchronousChannelGroup(ExecutorService,int)
     * openAsynchronousChannelGroup(ExecutorService,int)} method of the system-wide
     * default {@link AsynchronousChannelProvider} object.
