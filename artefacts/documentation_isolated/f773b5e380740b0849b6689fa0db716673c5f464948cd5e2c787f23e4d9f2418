     * Return a {@code Stream} that is lazily populated with {@code
     * Path} by searching for files in a file tree rooted at a given starting
     * file.
     *
     * <p> This method walks the file tree in exactly the manner specified by
     * the {@link #walk walk} method. For each file encountered, the given
     * {@link BiPredicate} is invoked with its {@link Path} and {@link
     * BasicFileAttributes}. The {@code Path} object is obtained as if by
     * {@link Path#resolve(Path) resolving} the relative path against {@code
     * start} and is only included in the returned {@link Stream} if
     * the {@code BiPredicate} returns true. Compare to calling {@link
     * java.util.stream.Stream#filter filter} on the {@code Stream}
     * returned by {@code walk} method, this method may be more efficient by
     * avoiding redundant retrieval of the {@code BasicFileAttributes}.
     *
     * <p> The returned stream encapsulates one or more {@link DirectoryStream}s.
     * If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the
     * {@code try}-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
     * stream's {@link Stream#close close} method is invoked after the stream
     * operations are completed.  Operating on a closed stream will result in an
     * {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.
     *
     * <p> If an {@link IOException} is thrown when accessing the directory
     * after returned from this method, it is wrapped in an {@link
     * UncheckedIOException} which will be thrown from the method that caused
     * the access to take place.
     *
     * @param   start
     *          the starting file
     * @param   maxDepth
     *          the maximum number of directory levels to search
     * @param   matcher
     *          the function used to decide whether a file should be included
     *          in the returned stream
     * @param   options
     *          options to configure the traversal
     *
     * @return  the {@link Stream} of {@link Path}
     *
     * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
     *          if the {@code maxDepth} parameter is negative
     * @throws  SecurityException
     *          If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
     *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
     *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead} method is invoked
     *          to check read access to the directory.
     * @throws  IOException
     *          if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.
