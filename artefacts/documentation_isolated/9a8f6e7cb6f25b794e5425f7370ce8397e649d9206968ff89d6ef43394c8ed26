     * Compares this object against the specified object.
     * The result is {@code true} if and only if the argument is
     * not {@code null} and it represents the same address as
     * this object.
     * <p>
     * Two instances of {@code InetSocketAddress} represent the same
     * address if both the InetAddresses (or hostnames if it is unresolved) and port
     * numbers are equal.
     * If both addresses are unresolved, then the hostname and the port number
     * are compared.
     *
     * Note: Hostnames are case insensitive. e.g. "FooBar" and "foobar" are
     * considered equal.
     *
     * @param   obj   the object to compare against.
     * @return  {@code true} if the objects are the same;
     *          {@code false} otherwise.
