     * Returns a permission object representing the permission
     * necessary to make the connection represented by this
     * object. This method returns null if no permission is
     * required to make the connection. By default, this method
     * returns {@code java.security.AllPermission}. Subclasses
     * should override this method and return the permission
     * that best represents the permission required to make a
     * a connection to the URL. For example, a {@code URLConnection}
     * representing a {@code file:} URL would return a
     * {@code java.io.FilePermission} object.
     *
     * <p>The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
     * connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
     * different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
     * sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
     * host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
     * the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
     * to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
     * be to bar.com.
     *
     * <p>Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
     * caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
     * the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
     * the first case, the permission should be obtained
     * <em>after</em> the object has been obtained. For example, in an
     * HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
     * to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
     * second case, the permission should be obtained and tested
     * <em>before</em> connecting.
     *
     * @return the permission object representing the permission
     * necessary to make the connection represented by this
     * URLConnection.
     *
     * @exception IOException if the computation of the permission
     * requires network or file I/O and an exception occurs while
     * computing it.
