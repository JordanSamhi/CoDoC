     * Log a message, specifying source class, method, and resource bundle name,
     * with associated Throwable information.
     * <p>
     * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message
     * level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord
     * which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.
     * <p>
     * The msg string is localized using the named resource bundle.  If the
     * resource bundle name is null, or an empty String or invalid
     * then the msg string is not localized.
     * <p>
     * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
     * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus it is
     * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
     * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
     * <p>
     * @param   level   One of the message level identifiers, e.g., SEVERE
     * @param   sourceClass    name of class that issued the logging request
     * @param   sourceMethod   name of method that issued the logging request
     * @param   bundleName     name of resource bundle to localize msg,
     *                         can be null
     * @param   msg     The string message (or a key in the message catalog)
     * @param   thrown  Throwable associated with log message.
     * @deprecated Use {@link #logrb(java.util.logging.Level, java.lang.String,
     *     java.lang.String, java.util.ResourceBundle, java.lang.String,
     *     java.lang.Throwable)} instead.
