     * Returns the match result of the last scanning operation performed
     * by this scanner. This method throws <code>IllegalStateException</code>
     * if no match has been performed, or if the last match was
     * not successful.
     *
     * <p>The various <code>next</code>methods of <code>Scanner</code>
     * make a match result available if they complete without throwing an
     * exception. For instance, after an invocation of the {@link #nextInt}
     * method that returned an int, this method returns a
     * <code>MatchResult</code> for the search of the
     * <a href="#Integer-regex"><i>Integer</i></a> regular expression
     * defined above. Similarly the {@link #findInLine},
     * {@link #findWithinHorizon}, and {@link #skip} methods will make a
     * match available if they succeed.
     *
     * @return a match result for the last match operation
     * @throws IllegalStateException  If no match result is available
